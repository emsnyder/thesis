abstract = {We investigate a class of rapidly growing emission line galaxies, known as "Green Peas", first noted by volunteers in the Galaxy Zoo project because of their peculiar bright green colour and small size, unresolved in SDSS imaging. Their appearance is due to very strong optical emission lines, namely [O III] 5007 A, with an unusually large equivalent width of up to {\~{}}1000 A. We discuss a well-defined sample of 251 colour-selected objects, most of which are strongly star forming, although there are some AGN interlopers including 8 newly discovered narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxies. The star-forming Peas are low mass galaxies (M{\~{}}10{\^{}}8.5 - 10{\^{}}10 M{\_}sun) with high star formation rates ({\~{}}10 M{\_}sun/yr), low metallicities (log[O/H] + 12 {\~{}} 8.7) and low reddening (E(B-V) {\textless} 0.25) and they reside in low density environments. They have some of the highest specific star formation rates (up to {\~{}}10{\^{}}{\{}-8{\}} yr{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}) seen in the local Universe, yielding doubling times for their stellar mass of hundreds of Myrs. The few star-forming Peas with HST imaging appear to have several clumps of bright star-forming regions and low surface density features that may indicate recent or ongoing mergers. The Peas are similar in size, mass, luminosity and metallicity to Luminous Blue Compact Galaxies. They are also similar to high redshift UV-luminous galaxies, e.g., Lyman-break galaxies and Lyman-alpha emitters, and therefore provide a local laboratory with which to study the extreme star formation processes that occur in high-redshift galaxies. Studying starbursting galaxies as a function of redshift is essential to understanding the build up of stellar mass in the Universe.},

abstract = {(Abridge) We present a new analysis of the early-type galaxy population in the central region of the Antlia cluster, focusing on the faint systems like dwarf ellipticals (dE) and dwarf spheroidals (dSph). We confirm 22 early-type galaxies as Antlia members, using GEMINI-GMOS and MAGELLAN-MIKE spectra. Among them, 2 belong to the rare type of compact ellipticals (cE), and 5 are new faint dwarfs that had never been catalogued before. In addition, we present 16 newly identified low surface brightness galaxy candidates, almost half of them displaying morphologies consistent with being Antlia's counterparts of Local Group dSphs, that extend the faint luminosity limit of our study down to MB = -10.1 (BT = 22.6) mag. We built an improved CMR in the Washington photometric system, i.e. integrated T1 magnitudes versus (C - T1) colours, which extends $\backslash$sim 4 mag faintwards the limit of spectroscopically confirmed Antlia members. When only confirmed early-type members are considered, this relation extends over 10 mag in luminosity with no apparent change in slope or increase in colour dispersion towards its faint end. The intrinsic colour scatter of the relation is compared with those reported for other clusters of galaxies; we argue that it is likely that the large scatter of the CMR, usually reported at faint magnitudes, is mostly due to photometric errors along with an improper membership/morphological classification. The distinct behaviour of the luminosity versus mean effective surface brightness relation at the bright and faint ends is analyzed, while it is confirmed that dE galaxies on the same relation present a very similar effective radius, regardless of their colour. The projected spatial distribution of the member sample confirms the existence of two groups in Antlia, each one dominated by a giant elliptical galaxy and with one cE located close to each giant.},

abstract = {The evolution of the large-scale distribution of matter is sensitive to a variety of fundamental parameters that characterise the dark matter, dark energy, and other aspects of our cosmological framework. Since the majority of the mass density is in the form of dark matter that cannot be directly observed, to do cosmology with large-scale structure one must use observable (baryonic) quantities that trace the underlying matter distribution in a (hopefully) predictable way. However, recent numerical studies have demonstrated that the mapping between observable and total mass, as well as the total mass itself, are sensitive to unresolved feedback processes associated with galaxy formation, motivating explicit calibration of the feedback efficiencies. Here we construct a new suite of large-volume cosmological hydrodynamical simulations (called BAHAMAS, for BAryons and HAloes of MAssive Systems) where subgrid models of stellar and Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) feedback have been calibrated to reproduce the present-day galaxy stellar mass function and the hot gas mass fractions of groups and clusters in order to ensure the effects of feedback on the overall matter distribution are broadly correct. We show that the calibrated simulations reproduce an unprecedentedly wide range of properties of massive systems, including the various observed mappings between galaxies, hot gas, total mass, and black holes, and represent a significant advance in our ability to mitigate the primary systematic uncertainty in most present large-scale structure tests.},

abstract = {The confirmation of a globular cluster (GC) in the recently discovered ultrafaint galaxy Eridanus II (Eri II) motivated us to examine the question posed in the title. After estimating the halo mass of Eri II using a published stellar mass - halo mass relation, the one GC in this galaxy supports extending the relationship between the number of GCs hosted by a galaxy and the galaxy's total mass about two orders of magnitude in stellar mass below the previous limit. For this empirically determined specific frequency of between 0.06 and 0.39 globular clusters per 10{\$}{\^{}}9{\$} {\$}M{\_}\backslashodot{\$} of total mass, the surviving Milky Way (MW) subhalos with masses smaller than {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}} M{\_}\backslashodot{\$} could host as many as 5 to 31 GCs, broadly consistent with the actual population of outer halo MW GCs, although matching the radial distribution in detail remains a challenge. Using a subhalo mass function from published high resolution numerical simulations and a Poissonian model for populating those halos with the aforementioned empirically constrained frequency, we find that about 90{\$}\backslash{\%}{\$} of these GCs lie in lower-mass subhalos than that of Eri II. From what we know about the stellar mass-halo mass function, the subhalo mass function, and the mass-normalized GC specific frequency, we conclude that some of the MW's outer halo GCs are likely to be hosted by undetected subhalos with extremely modest stellar populations.},

abstract = {We describe the goals, design, implementation, and initial progress of the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS), a seven year sky survey which began in May 2005, using the UKIRT Wide Field Camera. It is a portfolio of five survey components covering various combinations of the filter set ZYJHK and H{\_}2. The Large Area Survey, the Galactic Clusters Survey, and the Galactic Plane Survey cover approximately 7000 square degrees to a depth of K{\~{}}18; the Deep Extragalactic Survey covers 35 square degrees to K{\~{}}21, and the Ultra Deep Survey covers 0.77 square degrees to K{\~{}}23. Summed together UKIDSS is 12 times larger in effective volume than the 2MASS survey. The prime aim of UKIDSS is to provide a long term astronomical legacy database; the design is however driven by a series of specific goals -- for example to find the nearest and faintest sub-stellar objects; to discover Population II brown dwarfs, if they exist; to determine the substellar mass function; to break the z=7 quasar barrier; to determine the epoch of re-ionisation; to measure the growth of structure from z=3 to the present day; to determine the epoch of spheroid formation; and to map the Milky Way through the dust, to several kpc. The survey data are being uniformly processed, and released in stages through the WFCAM Science Archive (WSA : http://surveys.roe.ac.uk/wsa). Before the formal survey began, UKIRT and the UKIDSS consortium collaborated in obtaining and analysing a series of small science verification (SV) projects to complete the commissioning of the camera. We show some results from these SV projects in order to demonstrate the likely power of the eventual complete survey. Finally, using the data from the First Data Release we assess how well UKIDSS is meeting its design targets so far.},

@article{Janz2015,
abstract = {In recent years, a growing zoo of compact stellar systems (CSSs) have been found whose physical properties (mass, size, velocity dispersion) place them between classical globular clusters (GCs) and true galaxies, leading to debates about their nature. Here we present results using a so far underutilised discriminant, their stellar population properties. Based on new spectroscopy from 8-10m telescopes, we derive ages, metallicities, and [$\backslash$alpha/Fe] of 29 CSSs. These range from GCs with sizes of merely a few parsec to compact ellipticals larger than M32. Together with a literature compilation, this provides a panoramic view of the stellar population characteristics of early-type systems. We find that the CSSs are predominantly more metal rich than typical galaxies at the same stellar mass. At high mass, the compact ellipticals (cEs) depart from the mass-metallicity relation of massive early-type galaxies, which forms a continuous sequence with dwarf galaxies. At lower mass, the metallicity distribution of ultra-compact dwarfs (UCDs) changes at a few times {\$}10{\^{}}7{\$} M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}, which roughly coincides with the mass where luminosity function arguments previously suggested the GC population ends. The highest metallicities in CSSs are paralleled only by those of dwarf galaxy nuclei and the central parts of massive early types. These findings can be interpreted as CSSs previously being more massive and undergoing tidal interactions to obtain their current mass and compact size. Such an interpretation is supported by CSSs with direct evidence for tidal stripping, and by an examination of the CSS internal escape velocities.},

abstract = {We present a current catalog of 21 cm HI line sources extracted from the Arecibo Legacy Fast Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFALFA) survey over {\~{}}2800 square degrees of sky: the alpha.40 catalog. Covering 40{\%} of the final survey area, the alpha.40 catalog contains 15855 sources in the regions 07h30m {\textless} R.A. {\textless} 16h30m, +04 deg {\textless} Dec. {\textless} +16 deg and +24 deg {\textless} Dec. {\textless} +28 deg and 22h {\textless} R.A. {\textless} 03h, +14 deg {\textless} Dec. {\textless} +16 deg and +24 deg {\textless} Dec. {\textless} +32 deg. Of those, 15041 are certainly extragalactic, yielding a source density of 5.3 galaxies per square degree, a factor of 29 improvement over the catalog extracted from the HI Parkes All Sky Survey. In addition to the source centroid positions, HI line flux densities, recessional velocities and line widths, the catalog includes the coordinates of the most probable optical counterpart of each HI line detection, and a separate compilation provides a crossmatch to identifications given in the photometric and spectroscopic catalogs associated with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7. Fewer than 2{\%} of the extragalactic HI line sources cannot be identified with a feasible optical counterpart; some of those may be rare OH megamasers at 0.16 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.25. A detailed analysis is presented of the completeness, width dependent sensitivity function and bias inherent in the current alpha.40 catalog. The impact of survey selection, distance errors, current volume coverage and local large scale structure on the derivation of the HI mass function is assessed. While alpha.40 does not yet provide a completely representative sampling of cosmological volume, derivations of the HI mass function using future data releases from ALFALFA will further improve both statistical and systematic uncertainties.},

abstract = {We examine the evolution of intrinsic u-r colours of galaxies in the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, which has been shown to reproduce the observed redshift z=0.1 colour-magnitude distribution well. The median u-r of star-forming ('blue cloud') galaxies reddens by 1 mag from z=2 to 0 at fixed stellar mass, as their specific star formation rates decrease with time. A red sequence starts to build-up around z=1, due to the quenching of low-mass satellite galaxies at the faint end, and due to the quenching of more massive central galaxies by their active galactic nuclei (AGN) at the bright end. This leaves a dearth of intermediate-mass red sequence galaxies at z=1, which is mostly filled in by z=0. We quantify the time-scales of colour transition due to satellite and AGN quenching, finding that most galaxies spend less than 2 Gyr in the 'green valley'. On examining the trajectories of galaxies in a colour-stellar mass diagram, we identify three characteristic tracks that galaxies follow (quiescently star-forming, quenching and rejuvenating galaxies) and quantify the fraction of galaxies that follow each track.},

abstract = {We have combined UV to radio centimetric observations of resolved galaxies in the Virgo cluster with multizone, chemo-spectrophotometric models of galaxy evolution especially tailored to take into account the effects of the cluster environment (ram pressure stripping and starvation). This exercise has shown that anemic spirals with truncated radial profiles of the gas component and of the young stellar populations, typical in rich clusters of galaxies, have been perturbed by a recent (˜100 Myr) ram pressure stripping event induced by their interaction with the cluster intergalactic medium. Starvation is not able to reproduce the observed truncated radial profiles. Both ram pressure and starvation induce a decrease of the stellar surface brightness of the perturbed disc, and thus can hardly be invoked to explain the formation of lenticular galaxies inhabiting rich clusters, which are characterised by higher surface brightnesses than early type spirals of similar luminosity. In dwarfs the ram pressure stripping event is so efficient to totally remove their gas thus stopping on short time scales ({\textless}2 Gyr) their star formation activity. Low luminosity star forming discs can be transformed in dE galaxies.},

Since M32 lies in close proximity to the massive spiral M31, its structure has been modified by tidal effects due to M31. Such effects may also account for peculiarities in brightness profiles of several other dwarf elliptical companions to large galaxies. Because of their unusual appearance, these companions are considered as a separate structural class, i.e., compact ellipticals. The present investigation is based on the assumption that the types of dwarf elliptical galaxies seen in the Local Group provide a representative sample of low luminosity ellipticals.

abstract = {Taking advantage of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe82, we have explored the spatial distribution of ultra diffuse galaxies (UDGs) within an area of 8x8 Mpc{\^{}}2 centered around the galaxy cluster Abell 168 (z=0.045). This intermediate massive cluster (sigma=550 km/s) is surrounded by a complex large scale structure, rich in filaments and groups. This allows us to probe the large scale distribution of UDGs and address the question whether the infalling structures fed the cluster with new UDGs. We find that UDGs are located within the large scale structures that comprise the Abell 168 overdensity. Approximately 42{\%} of the UDGs analysed inhabit the cluster region: {\~{}}7+-3{\%} in the core and {\~{}}35+-7{\%} in the outskirts whereas the remaining UDGs are found outside the main overdensity: {\~{}}19+-5{\%} in groups and {\~{}}40{\%} in filaments. UDGs structural properties gradually change from the lowest to the densest regions with a decrease of their stellar mass by a factor of {\~{}}1.5, an increase of their Sersic index n by a factor of {\~{}}1.25 and a decrease in their axis ratio (b/a) by a factor of {\~{}}1.13. This transformation supports the idea that UDGs probably form outside clusters and are later on accreted towards the cluster's central regions, where they are finally destroyed by disruption. Finally, the spatial distribution of the UDGs is very similar to the one found for dwarf galaxies but significantly different from the distribution of galaxies like the Milky Way, suggesting that UDGs could be bona fide dwarfs and not failed L* galaxies.},

abstract = {We recently initiated a search for ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) in the Centaurus galaxy cluster (Mieske et al. 2007), resulting in the discovery of 27 compact objects with -12.2{\textless}M{\_}V{\textless}-10.9 mag. Our overall survey completeness was 15-20{\%} within 120 kpc projected clustercentric distance. In order to better constrain the luminosity distribution of the brightest UCDs in Centaurus, we continue our search by substantially improving our survey completeness specifically in the regime M{\_}V{\textless}-12 mag (V{\_}0{\textless}21.3 mag). Using VIMOS at the VLT, we obtain low-resolution spectra of 400 compact objects with 19.3{\textless}V{\_}0{\textless}21.3 mag (-14{\textless}M{\_}V{\textless}-12 mag at the Centaurus distance) in the central 25' of the Centaurus cluster, which corresponds to a projected radius of {\~{}}150 kpc. Our survey yields complete area coverage within {\~{}}120 kpc. For 94{\%} of the sources included in the masks we successfully measure a redshift. Due to incompleteness in the slit assignment, our final completeness in the area surveyed is 52{\%}. Among our targets we find three new UCDs in the magnitude range -12.2{\textless}M{\_}V{\textless}-12 mag, hence at the faint limit of our survey. One of them is covered by archival HST WFPC2 imaging, yielding a size estimate of r{\_}h {\textless}= 8-9 pc. At 95{\%} confidence we can reject the hypothesis that in the area surveyed there are more than 2 massive UCDs with M{\_}V{\textless}-12.2 mag and r{\_}eff {\textless}=70 pc. Our survey hence confirms the extreme rareness of massive UCDs. We find that the radial distributions of Centaurus and Fornax UCDs with respect to their host clusters' centers agree within the 2 sigma level.},

abstract = {Aims: We analyse the properties of the early-type dwarf galaxy population (MV {\textgreater} -17 mag) in the Hydra I cluster. We investigate the galaxy luminosity function (LF), the colour-magnitude relation (CMR), and the magnitude-surface brightness relation down to MV {\~{}} -10 mag. Another goal of this study is to find candidates for ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) in Hydra I.  Methods: Two spectroscopic surveys performed with Magellan I/LDSS2 at Las Campanas Observatory and VLT/VIMOS, as well as deep VLT/FORS1 images in V and I bands, covering the central parts of the cluster, were examined. We identify cluster members by radial velocity measurements and select other cluster galaxy candidates by their morphology and low surface brightness. The candidates' total magnitudes and central surface brightnesses were derived from the analysis of their surface brightness profiles. To determine the faint-end slope of the LF, the galaxy number counts are completeness corrected.  Results: We obtain radial velocities for 126 objects and identify 32 cluster members, of which 5 are previously uncatalogued dwarf galaxies. One possible UCD candidate with MV = -13.26 mag is found. Our sample of ≃100 morphologically selected dwarf galaxies with M{\_}V{\textgreater}-17 mag defines a CMR that extends the CMR of the giant cluster galaxies to the magnitude limit of our survey (MV {\~{}} -10 mag). It matches the relations found for the Local Group (LG) and the Fornax cluster dwarf galaxies almost perfectly. The Hydra I dwarf galaxies also follow a magnitude-surface brightness relation that is very similar to that of the LG dwarf galaxies. Moreover, we observe a continuous relation for dwarf galaxies and giant early-type galaxies when plotting the central surface brightness $\mu$0 of a S{\'{e}}rsic model vs. the galaxy magnitude. The effective radius is found to be largely independent of the luminosity for MV {\textgreater} -18 mag. It is consistent with a constant value of Re {\~{}} 0.8 kpc. We present the photometric parameters of the galaxies as the Hydra I Cluster Catalogue (HCC). By fitting a Schechter function to the luminosity distribution, we derive a very flat faint-end slope of the LF ($\alpha$ = -1.13 ± 0.04), whereas fitting a power law for MV {\textgreater} -14 mag gives $\alpha$ = -1.40 ± 0.18.  Conclusions: Our findings of a continuous CMR and $\mu$0 - MV relation for dwarf and giant early-type galaxies suggests that they are the same class of objects. The similarity of those relations to other environments like the LG implies that internal processes could be more important for their global photometric properties than external influences.

abstract = {(Abridged) We investigate the intrinsic shapes of low-luminosity galaxies in the central 300 kpc of the Virgo cluster using deep imaging obtained as part of the NGVS. We build a sample of nearly 300 red-sequence cluster members in the yet unexplored {\$}-14 {\textless} M{\_}{\{}g{\}} {\textless} -8{\$} magnitude range. The observed distribution of apparent axis ratios is then fit by families of triaxial models with normally-distributed intrinsic ellipticities and triaxialities. We develop a Bayesian framework to explore the posterior distribution of the model parameters, which allows us to work directly on discrete data, and to account for individual, surface brightness-dependent axis ratio uncertainties. For this population we infer a mean intrinsic ellipticity E=0.43, and a mean triaxiality T=0.16. This implies that faint Virgo galaxies are best described as a family of thick, nearly oblate spheroids with mean intrinsic axis ratios 1:0.94:0.57. We additionally attempt a study of the intrinsic shapes of Local Group satellites of similar luminosities. For the LG population we infer a slightly larger mean intrinsic ellipticity E=0.51, and the paucity of objects with round apparent shapes translates into more triaxial mean shapes, 1:0.76:0.49. We finally compare the intrinsic shapes of NGVS low-mass galaxies with samples of more massive quiescent systems, and with field, star-forming galaxies of similar luminosities. We find that the intrinsic flattening in this low-luminosity regime is almost independent of the environment in which the galaxy resides--but there is a hint that objects may be slightly rounder in denser environments. The comparable flattening distributions of low-luminosity galaxies that have experienced very different degrees of environmental effects suggests that internal processes are the main drivers of galaxy structure at low masses--with external mechanisms playing a secondary role.},

The question was adressed whether the UCOs constitute a distinct population of objects not linked to globular clusters or whether there is a smooth transition between both populations. Therefore, a spectroscopic survey on compact objects in the central region of the Fornax cluster was carried out with the 2.5 m du Pont telescope (LCO). UCOs and the bright NGC 1399 globular clusters with similar brightness were inspected. 12 GCs from the bright end of the globular cluster luminosity function have been identified as Fornax members. Eight are new members, four were known as members from before. Their magnitude distribution supports a smooth transition between the faint UCOs and the bright globular clusters. There is no evidence for a magnitude gap between both populations. However, the brightest UCO clearly stands out; it is too bright and too large to be accounted for by globular clusters. For the only UCO included in our survey, a relatively high metallicity of [Fe/H] ={\~{}} -0.5 dex is measured.},

abstract = {Observations of local galaxies harbouring supermassive black holes (BH) of anomalously high mass, M{\_}BH, relative to their stellar mass, M{\_}star, appear to be at odds with simple models of the co-evolution between galaxies and their central BHs. We study the origin of such outliers in a LCDM context using the EAGLE cosmological, hydrodynamical simulation. We find 15 "M{\_}BH(M{\_}star)-outlier" galaxies, defined as having M{\_}BH more than 1.5 dex above the median M{\_}BH(M{\_}star) relation in the simulation, M{\_}{\{}BH,med{\}}. All M{\_}BH(M{\_}star)-outliers are satellite galaxies, typically with M{\_}star {\~{}} 10{\^{}}10 M{\_}sun and M{\_}BH {\~{}} 10{\^{}}8 M{\_}sun. They have all become outliers primarily due to tidal stripping of their outer stellar component acting over several Gyr, with a secondary effect of rapid BH growth at high-z causing some to lie approximately 1 dex above the z=0 relation prior to stripping. The same mechanisms also cause the M{\_}BH(M{\_}star)-outlier satellites to be amongst the most compact galaxies in the simulation, making them ideal candidates for ultracompact dwarf galaxy progenitors. The 10 most extreme central galaxies found at z=0 (with log{\_}{\{}10{\}}(M{\_}BH/M{\_}{\{}BH,med{\}}) in [1.2, 1.5]) grow rapidly in M{\_}BH to lie well above the present-day M{\_}BH-M{\_}star relation at early times (z {\textgreater} 2), and either continue to evolve parallel to the z=0 relation or remain unchanged until the present day, making them "relics" of the high-redshift universe. This high-z formation mechanism may help to explain the origin of observed M{\_}BH(M{\_}star)-outliers with extended dark matter haloes and undisturbed morphologies.},

abstract = {Ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) and dwarf galaxy nuclei have many common properties, such as internal velocity dispersions and colour-magnitude trends, suggesting tidally stripped dwarf galaxies as a possible UCD origin. However, UCDs typically have sizes more than twice as large as nuclei at the same luminosity. We use a graphics processing unit (GPU)-enab led version of the particle-mesh code SUPERBOX to study the possibility of turning nucleated dwarf galaxies into UCDs by tidally stripping them in a Virgo-like galaxy cluster. We find that motion in spherical potentials, where close passages happen many times, leads to the formation of compact (rh ≲ 20 pc) star clusters/UCDs. In contrast, orbital motion where close passages happen only once or twice leads to the formation of extended objects which are large enough to account for the full range of observed UCD sizes. For such motion, we find that dwarf galaxies need close pericentre passages with distances less than 10 kpc to undergo strong enough stripping so that UCD formation is possible. As tidal stripping produces objects with similar properties to UCDs, and our estimates suggest dwarf galaxies have been destroyed in sufficient numbers to explain the observed number of UCDs in M87, we consider tidal stripping to be a likely origin of UCDs. However, comparison with cosmological simulations is needed to determine if the number and spatial distribution of UCDs formed by tidal stripping matches the observations of UCDs in galaxy clusters.},

abstract = {We identify galaxy groups and clusters in volume-limited samples of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) redshift survey, using a redshift-space friends-of-friends algorithm. We optimize the friends-of-friends linking lengths to recover galaxy systems that occupy the same dark matter halos, using a set of mock catalogs created by populating halos of N-body simulations with galaxies. Extensive tests with these mock catalogs show that no combination of perpendicular and line-of-sight linking lengths is able to yield groups and clusters that simultaneously recover the true halo multiplicity function, projected size distribution, and velocity dispersion. We adopt a linking length combination that yields, for galaxy groups with 10 or more members: a group multiplicity function that is unbiased with respect to the true halo multiplicity function; an unbiased median relation between the multiplicities of groups and their associated halos; a spurious group fraction of less than {\~{}}1{\%} a halo completeness of more than {\~{}}97{\%} the correct projected size distribution as a function of multiplicity; and a velocity dispersion distribution that is {\~{}}20{\%} too low at all multiplicities. These results hold over a range of mock catalogs that use different input recipes of populating halos with galaxies. We apply our group-finding algorithm to the SDSS data and obtain three group and cluster catalogs for three volume-limited samples that cover 3495.1 deg2 on the sky, go out to redshifts of 0.1, 0.068, and 0.045, and contain 57,138, 37,820, and 18,895 galaxies, respectively. We correct for incompleteness caused by fiber collisions and survey edges and obtain measurements of the group multiplicity function, with errors calculated from realistic mock catalogs. These multiplicity function measurements provide a key constraint on the relation between galaxy populations and dark matter halos.},

abstract = {Continuing our study of galaxy populations in the Antlia cluster, we present a photometric analysis of four galaxies classified as compact elliptical (cE) galaxies in the 1990 Antlia Group catalogue of Ferguson and Sandage. Until now, there have been only six known members of this rare type of galaxy. Using data from various photometric systems (Washington C, Kron-Cousins R, Bessel V and I, Hubble Space Telesecope F814W and F435W), we measured the brightness and colour profiles, as well as the structural parameters. By comparing these with those of other galaxies in the Antlia cluster, as well as with confirmed cE galaxies from the literature, we found that two of the cE candidates, although spectroscopically confirmed Antlia members, are not cE galaxies. However, one of these objects presents strong ellipticity and position angle variations that resemble those already reported for M32, leading us to speculate about this type of object being a progenitor of a cE galaxy. The other two cE candidates, for which radial velocities are not available, match some features typical of cE galaxies, such as being close in projection to a larger galaxy, displaying flat colour profiles, and having a high degree of compactness. Only one of the remaining cE candidates shows a high central surface brightness, two components in its brightness profile and distinct changes in ellipticity and position angle where the outer component begins to dominate. It seems to follow the same trend as other confirmed cE galaxies in a luminosity versus mean effective surface brightness diagram. Moreover, it shows a distorted inner structure with similar characteristics to those found by simulations of interacting galaxies. Also, an extremely faint structure, which seems to link this object with one of the Antlia dominant galaxies, has been detected in images from the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory MOSAIC, the Very Large Telescope FORS1 and the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys. The cE nature of this galaxy and the possible interaction with its bright companion still have to be confirmed using spectroscopy.  This paper is based on observations carried out at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (Chile), at Las Campanas Observatory (Chile), and at the European Southern Observatory, Paranal (Chile) [Program 71.B-0122(A)]. It is also based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained from the data archive at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.

Here we present a first detailed study of metallicity-environment correlations in a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, in particular the Illustris simulation. Illustris galaxies display similar relations to those observed. Utilizing knowledge of simulated formation histories, and leveraging the large simulation volume, we construct galaxy samples of satellites and centrals that are matched in formation histories. This allows us to find that {\~{}}1/3 of the metallicity-environment correlation is due to different formation histories in different environments. This is a combined effect of satellites (in particular in denser environments) having average lower z=0 star-formation rates (SFRs), and of their older stellar ages even at a given z=0 SFR. Most of the difference, {\~{}}2/3, is however caused by the higher concentration of the star-forming disks of satellite galaxies, since it biases their SFR-weighted metallicities towards their inner, more metal-rich, parts. With a newly defined quantity, the 'radially-averaged' metallicity, which captures the metallicity profile but is independent of the SFR profile, metallicities of satellites and centrals become environmentally independent, once matched in formation history. We find that circumgalactic metallicity (defined as rapidly inflowing gas around the virial radius), while sensitive to environment, has no measurable effect on the metallicity of the star-forming gas inside the galaxies.},

abstract = {The blue compact dwarf galaxy NGC 5253 hosts a very young starburst containing twin nuclear star clusters, separated by a projected distance of 5 pc. One cluster ({\#}5) coincides with the peak of the H-alpha emission and the other ({\#}11) with a massive ultracompact H II region. A recent analysis of these clusters shows that they have a photometric age of 1+/-1 Myr, in apparent contradiction with the age of 3-5 Myr inferred from the presence of Wolf-Rayet features in the cluster {\#}5 spectrum. We examine Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet and Very Large Telescope optical spectroscopy of {\#}5 and show that the stellar features arise from very massive stars (VMS), with masses greater than 100 Msun, at an age of 1-2 Myr. We further show that the very high ionizing flux from the nuclear clusters can only be explained if VMS are present. We investigate the origin of the observed nitrogen enrichment in the circum-cluster ionized gas and find that the excess N can be produced by massive rotating stars within the first 1 Myr. We find similarities between the NGC 5253 cluster spectrum and those of metal poor, high redshift galaxies. We discuss the presence of VMS in young, star-forming galaxies at high redshift; these should be detected in rest frame UV spectra to be obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope. We emphasize that population synthesis models with upper mass cut-offs greater than 100 Msun are crucial for future studies of young massive star clusters at all redshifts.},

abstract = {We present spatially-resolved internal kinematics and stellar chemical abundances for a sample of dwarf elliptical (dE) galaxies in the Virgo Cluster observed with Keck/ESI. We find that 4 out of 17 dEs have major axis rotation velocities consistent with rotational flattening, while the remaining dEs have no detectable major axis rotation. Despite this difference in internal kinematics, rotating and non-rotating dEs are remarkably similar in terms of their position in the Fundamental Plane, morphological structure, stellar populations, and local environment. We present evidence for faint underlying disks and/or weak substructure in a fraction of both rotating and non-rotating dEs, but a comparable number of counter-examples exist for both types which show no evidence of such structure. Absorption-line strengths were determined based on the Lick/IDS system (Hbeta, Mgb, Fe5270, Fe5335) for the central region of each galaxy. We find no difference in the line-strength indices, and hence stellar populations, between rotating and non-rotating dE galaxies. The best-fitting mean age and metallicity for our 17 dE sample are 5 Gyr and Fe/H = -0.3 dex, respectively, with rms spreads of 3 Gyr and 0.1 dex. The majority of dEs are consistent with solar alpha/Fe abundance ratios. By contrast, the stellar populations of classical elliptical galaxies are, on average, older, more metal rich, and alpha-enhanced relative to our dE sample. The local environments of both dEs types appear to be diverse in terms of their proximity to larger galaxies in real or velocity space within the Virgo Cluster. Thus, rotating and non-rotating dEs are remarkably similar in terms of their structure, stellar content, and local environments, presenting a significant challenge to theoretical models of their formation.

abstract = {(Abridged) Using luminosities and structural parameters of globular clusters (GCs) in the nuclear regions (nGCs) of low-mass dwarf galaxies from HST/ACS imaging we derive the present-day escape velocities (v{\_}esc) of stellar ejecta to reach the cluster tidal radius and compare them with those of Galactic GCs with extended (hot) horizontal branches (EHBs-GCs). For EHB-GCs, we find a correlation between the present-day v{\_}esc and their metallicity as well as (V-I){\_}0 colour. The similar v{\_}esc, (V-I){\_}0 distribution of nGCs and EHB-GCs implies that nGCs could also have complex stellar populations. The v{\_}esc-[Fe/H] relation could reflect the known relation of increasing stellar wind velocity with metallicity, which in turn could explain why more metal-poor clusters typically show more peculiarities in their stellar population than more metal-rich clusters of the same mass do. Thus the cluster v{\_}esc can be used as parameter to describe the degree of self-enrichment. The nGCs populate the same Mv vs. rh region as EHB-GCs, although they do not reach the sizes of the largest EHB-GCs like wCen and NGC 2419. We argue that during accretion the rh of an nGC could increase due to significant mass loss in the cluster vicinity and the resulting drop in the external potential in the core once the dwarf galaxy dissolves. Our results support the scenario in which Galactic EHB-GCs have originated in the centres of pre-Galactic building blocks or dwarf galaxies that were later accreted by the Milky Way.},

abstract = {Accurate estimation of the merger timescale of galaxy clusters is important to understand the cluster merger process and further the formation and evolution of the large-scale structure of the universe. In this paper, we explore a baryonic effect on the merger timescale of galaxy clusters by using hydrodynamical simulations. We find that the baryons play an important role in accelerating the merger process. The merger timescale decreases with increasing the gas fraction of galaxy clusters. For example, the merger timescale is shortened by a factor of up to 3 for merging clusters with gas fractions 0.15, compared with the timescale obtained with zero gas fractions. The baryonic effect is significant for a wide range of merger parameters and especially more significant for nearly head-on mergers and high merging velocities. The baryonic effect on the merger timescale of galaxy clusters is expected to have impacts on the structure formation in the universe, such as the cluster mass function and massive substructures in galaxy clusters, and a bias of "no-gas" may exist in the results obtained from the dark matter-only cosmological simulations.},

By mining astronomical survey data, we have now found 195 compact elliptical galaxies in all types of environment. They all share similar dynamical and stellar population properties. Dynamical analysis for nonisolated galaxies demonstrates the feasibility of their ejection from host clusters and groups by three-body encounters, which is in agreement with numerical simulations. Hence, isolated compact elliptical and isolated quiescent dwarf galaxies are tidally stripped systems that ran away from their hosts.},

abstract = {Knowledge of galaxy evolution rests on cross-sectional observations of different objects at different times. Understanding of galaxy evolution rests on longitudinal interpretations of how these data relate to individual objects moving through time. The connection between the two is generally assumed to be clear, but we use a simple "physics-free" model to show that it is not and that exploring its nuances can lead to new insights. Comprising nothing more than {\$}\backslashsim2000{\$} loosely constrained lognormal star formation histories, the model faithfully reproduces the following data it was never designed to match: stellar mass functions at {\$}z\backslashleq8{\$}; the slope of the star formation rate/stellar mass relation (the SF "Main Sequence") at {\$}z\backslashleq6{\$}; the mean {\$}{\{}\backslashrm sSFR{\}}(\backslashequiv{\{}\backslashrm SFR{\}}/M{\_}*){\$} of low-mass galaxies at {\$}z\backslashleq7{\$}; "fast-" and "slow-track quenching"; galaxy downsizing; and a correlation between formation timescale and {\$}{\{}\backslashrm sSFR{\}}(M{\_}*,t){\$} similar to recent results from simulations that provides a natural connection to bulge growth. We take these surprising findings -- which ultimately imply that quenching is the "peeling-off" of the densest tail of the starforming population at any epoch -- to mean either that: (1) models in which galaxies are diversified on long timescales by something akin to initial conditions rival the dominant "grow-and-quench" framework as good descriptions of the data; or (2) cornerstone metrics of galaxy evolution are too information-poor -- if not intrinsically misleading -- to confirm a unique explanation. We outline future tests of our model but stress that, even if it is shown to be incorrect, it illustrates how exploring different evolutionary paradigms can aid learning and, we hope, more detailed modeling efforts.},

abstract = {We use the high-resolution Aquarius cosmological dark matter simulations coupled to the semi-analytic model by Starkenburg et al. (2013) to study the HI content and velocity width properties of field galaxies at the low mass end in the context of {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM. We compare our predictions to the observed ALFALFA survey HI mass and velocity width functions, and find very good agreement without fine-tuning, when considering central galaxies. Furthermore, the properties of the dark matter halos hosting galaxies, characterised by their peak velocity and circular velocity at 2 radial disk scalelengths overlap perfectly with the inferred values from observations. This suggests that our galaxies are placed in the right dark matter halos, and consequently at face value, we do not find any discrepancy with the predictions from the {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM model. Our analysis indicates that previous tensions, apparent when using abundance matching models, arise because this technique cannot be straightforwardly applied for objects with masses {\$}M{\_}{\{}vir{\}} {\textless} 10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}} M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}.},

abstract = {Ultra Compact Dwarf Galaxies (UCDs) and dwarf galaxy nuclei have many common properties, such as internal velocity dispersions and colour-magnitude trends, suggesting tidally stripped dwarf galaxies as a possible UCD origin. However, UCDs typically have sizes more than twice as large as nuclei at the same luminosity. We use a GPU-enabled version of the particle-mesh code $\backslash$textsc{\{}superbox{\}} to study the possibility of turning nucleated dwarf galaxies into UCDs by tidally stripping them in a Virgo-like galaxy cluster. We find that motion in spherical potentials, where close passages happen many times, leads to the formation of compact ({\$}r{\_}h \backslashlesssim 20{\$} pc) star clusters/UCDs. In contrast, orbital motion where close passages happen only once or twice leads to the formation of extended objects which are large enough to account for the full range of observed UCD sizes. For such motion, we find that dwarf galaxies need close pericentre passages with distances less than 10 kpc to undergo strong enough stripping so that UCD formation is possible. As tidal stripping produces objects with similar properties to UCDs, and our estimates suggest dwarf galaxies have been destroyed in sufficient numbers to explain the observed number of UCDs in M87, we consider tidal stripping to be a likely origin of UCDs. However, comparison with cosmological simulations is needed to determine if the number and spatial distribution of UCDs formed by tidal stripping matches the observations of UCDs in galaxy clusters.},

abstract = {We exploit data from the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS) to study the extended structures of M31's dwarf elliptical companions, NGC147 and NGC185. Our wide-field, homogeneous photometry allows to construct deep colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) which reach down to {\$}\backslashsim3{\$} mag below the red giant branch (RGB) tip. We trace the stellar components of the galaxies to surface brightness of {\$}\backslashmu{\_}g \backslashsim 32{\$} mag arcsec{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$} and show they have much larger extents ({\$}\backslashsim5{\$} kpc radii) than previously recognised. While NGC185 retains a regular shape in its peripheral regions, NGC147 exhibits pronounced isophotal twisting due to the emergence of symmetric tidal tails. We fit single Sersic models to composite surface brightness profiles constructed from diffuse light and star counts and find that NGC147 has an effective radius almost 3 times that of NGC185. In both cases, the effective radii that we calculate are larger by a factor of {\$}\backslashsim2{\$} compared to most literature values. We also calculate revised total magnitudes of {\$}M{\_}g=-15.36\backslashpm0.04{\$} for NGC185 and {\$}M{\_}g=-16.36\backslashpm0.04{\$} for NGC147. Using photometric metallicities computed for RGB stars, we find NGC185 to exhibit a metallicity gradient of [Fe/H]{\$}\backslashsim-0.15{\$} dex/kpc over the radial range 0.125 to 0.5 deg. On the other hand, NGC147 exhibits almost no metallicity gradient, {\$}\backslashsim-0.02{\$} dex/kpc from 0.2 to 0.6 deg. The differences in the structure and stellar populations in the outskirts of these systems suggest that tidal influences have played an important role in governing the evolution of NGC147.},

All the imaging data have been reprocessed with an improved sky-subtraction algorithm and a final, self-consistent photometric recalibration and flat-field determination. This release also includes all data from the second phase of the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Evolution (SEGUE-2), consisting of spectroscopy of approximately 118,000 stars at both high and low Galactic latitudes.

We find that, at fixed stellar mass, the average {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm gas{\}}/M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm dust{\}}{\$} ratio varies by no more than a factor of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}2 when moving from field to cluster galaxies, with Virgo galaxies being slightly more dust rich (per unit of gas) than isolated systems. Remarkably, once the molecular and atomic hydrogen phases are investigated separately, we find that $\backslash$hi-deficient galaxies have at the same time lower {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm HI{\}}/M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm dust{\}}{\$} ratio but higher {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm H{\_}{\{}2{\}}{\}}/M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm dust{\}}{\$} ratio than $\backslash$hi-normal systems. In other words, they are poorer in atomic but richer in molecular hydrogen if normalized to their dust content. By comparing our findings with the predictions of theoretical models, we show that the opposite behavior observed in the {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm HI{\}}/M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm dust{\}}{\$} and {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm H{\_}{\{}2{\}}{\}}/M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm dust{\}}{\$} ratios is fully consistent with outside-in stripping of the interstellar medium (ISM), and is simply a consequence of the different distribution of dust, $\backslash$hi$\backslash$ and H{\$}{\_}{\{}2{\}}{\$} across the disk. Our results demonstrate that the small environmental variations in the total {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm gas{\}}/M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm dust{\}}{\$} ratio, as well as in the gas-phase metallicity, do not automatically imply that environmental mechanisms are not able to affect the dust and metal content of the ISM in galaxies.},

abstract = {Cosmological simulations of galaxy formation appear to show a two-phase character with a rapid early phase at z{\textgreater}2 during which in-situ stars are formed within the galaxy from infalling cold gas followed by an extended phase since z{\textless}3 during which ex-situ stars are primarily accreted. In the latter phase massive systems grow considerably in mass and radius by accretion of smaller satellite stellar systems formed at quite early times (z{\textgreater}3) outside of the virial radius of the forming central galaxy. These tentative conclusions are obtained from high resolution re-simulations of 39 individual galaxies in a full cosmological context with present-day virial halo masses ranging from 7e11 M{\_}sun h{\^{}}-1 {\textless} M{\_}vir {\textless} 2.7e13 M{\_}sun h{\^{}}-1 and central galaxy masses between 4.5e10 M{\_}sun h{\^{}}-1 {\textless} M{\_}* {\textless} 3.6e11 M{\_}sun h{\^{}}-1. The simulations include the effects of a uniform UV background, radiative cooling, star formation and energetic feedback from SNII. The importance of stellar accretion increases with galaxy mass and towards lower redshift. In our simulations lower mass galaxies ({\$}M{\_}* {\textless} 9e10 M{\_}sun h{\^{}}-1) accrete about 60 per cent of their present-day stellar mass. High mass galaxy ({\$}M{\_}* {\textgreater} 1.7e11 M{\_}sun h{\^{}}-1) assembly is dominated by accretion and merging with about 80 per cent of the stars added by the present-day. In general the simulated galaxies approximately double their mass since z=1. For massive systems this mass growth is not accompanied by significant star formation. The majority of the in-situ created stars is formed at z{\textgreater}2, primarily out of cold gas flows. We recover the observational result of archaeological downsizing, where the most massive galaxies harbor the oldest stars. We find that this is not in contradiction with hierarchical structure formation. Most stars in the massive galaxies are formed early on in smaller structures, the galaxies themselves are assembled late.},

We present the dynamical properties of 97 spectroscopically confirmed UCDs (rh {\textgreater}{\~{}}10 pc) and 911 GCs associated with central cD galaxy of the Virgo cluster, M87. Our UCDs, of which 89{\%} have M{\_}star {\textgreater} {\~{}}2X10{\^{}}6 M{\_}sun and 92{\%} are as blue as the classic blue GCs, nearly triple the sample of previous confirmed Virgo UCDs, providing by far the best opportunity for studying the global dynamics of a UCD system. We found that (1) UCDs have a surface number density profile that is shallower than that of the blue GCs in the inner {\~{}} 70 kpc and as steep as that of the red GCs at larger radii; (2) UCDs exhibit a significantly stronger rotation than the GCs, and the blue GCs seem to have a velocity field that is more consistent with that of the surrounding dwarf ellipticals than with that of UCDs; (3) UCDs have a radially increasing orbital anisotropy profile, and are tangentially-biased at radii {\textless} {\~{}} 40 kpc and radially-biased further out. In contrast, the blue GCs become more tangentially-biased at larger radii beyond {\~{}} 40 kpc; (4) GCs with M{\_}star {\textgreater} 2X10{\^{}}6 M{\_}sun have rotational properties indistinguishable from the less massive ones, suggesting that it is the size, instead of mass, that differentiates UCDs from GCs as kinematically distinct populations. We conclude that most UCDs in M87 are not consistent with being merely the most luminous and extended examples of otherwise normal GCs. The radially-biased orbital structure of UCDs at large radii is in general agreement with the "tidally threshed dwarf galaxy" scenario.},

abstract = {Luminous Compact Blue Galaxies (LCBGs) are an extreme star-bursting population of galaxies that were far more common at earlier epochs than today. Based on spectroscopic and photometric measurements of LCBGs in massive (M {\textgreater}10{\^{}}15 M{\_}sun), intermediate redshift (0.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.9) galaxy clusters, we present their rest-frame properties including star-formation rate, dynamical mass, size, luminosity, and metallicity. The appearance of these small, compact galaxies in clusters at intermediate redshift helps explain the observed redshift evolution in the size-luminosity relationship among cluster galaxies. In addition, we find the rest-frame properties of LCBGs appearing in galaxy clusters are indistinguishable from field LCBGs at the same redshift. Up to 35{\%} of the LCBGs show significant discrepancies between optical and infrared indicators of star formation, suggesting that star formation occurs in obscured regions. Nonetheless, the star formation for LCBGs shows a decrease toward the center of the galaxy clusters. Based on their position and velocity, we estimate that up to 10{\%} of cluster LCBGs are likely to merge with another cluster galaxy. Finally, the observed properties and distributions of the LCBGs in these clusters lead us to conclude that we are witnessing the quenching of the progenitors of dwarf elliptical galaxies that dominate the number density of present-epoch galaxy clusters.},

abstract = {We present the new catalog of principal galaxies (PGC2003). It constitutes the framework of the HYPERLEDA database that supersedes the LEDA one, with more data and more capabilities. The catalog is still restricted to confirmed galaxies, i.e. about one million galaxies, brighter than {\~{}}18 B-mag.  In order to provide the best possible identification for each galaxy we give: accurate coordinates (typical accuracy better than 2 arcsec), diameter, axis ratio and position angle. Diameters and axis ratios have been homogenized to the RC2 system at the limiting surface brightness of 25 B-mag arcsec-2, using a new method, the EPIDEMIC method.  In order to provide the best designation for each galaxy, we collected the names from 50 catalogues. The compatibility of the spelling is tested against NED and SIMBAD, and, as far as possible we used a spelling compatible with both. For some cases, where no consensus exists between NED, SIMBAD and LEDA, we propose some changes that could make the spelling of names fully compatible.  The full catalog is distributed through the CDS and can be extracted from HYPERLEDA.

This object (MB = -15.98 mag, Re = 0.24 kpc) becomes the fifth cE where the spatially resolved kinematics and stellar populations can be obtained. We used archival HST WFPC2 images to demonstrate that its light profile has a two-component structure, and integrated photometry from GALEX, SDSS, UKIDSS and Spitzer to build the multiwavelength spectral energy distribution to constrain the star formation history (SFH). We observed this galaxy with the PMAS IFU spectrograph at the Calar-Alto 3.5-m telescope and obtained two-dimensional maps of its kinematics and stellar population properties using the full-spectral fitting technique. Its structural, dynamical and stellar population properties suggest that it had a massive progenitor heavily tidally stripped by NGC 5846.

abstract = {We study the effects of applying observational techniques to derive the properties of simulated galaxies, with the aim of making an unbiased comparison between observations and simulations. For our study, we used fifteen galaxies simulated in a cosmological context using three different feedback and chemical enrichment models, and compared their z=0 properties with data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We show that the physical properties obtained directly from the simulations without post-processing can be very different to those obtained mimicking observational techniques. In order to provide simulators a way to reliably compare their galaxies with SDSS data, for each physical property that we studied - colours, magnitudes, gas and stellar metallicities, mean stellar ages and star formation rates - we give scaling relations that can be easily applied to the values extracted from the simulations. These scalings have in general a high correlation, except for the galaxy mean stellar ages and gas oxygen metallicities. Our simulated galaxies are photometrically similar to galaxies in the blue cloud/green valley, but in general they appear older, passive and with lower metal content compared to most of the spirals in SDSS. As a careful assessment of the agreement/disagreement with observations is the primary test of the baryonic physics implemented in hydrodynamical codes, our study shows that considering the observational biases in the derivation of the galaxies' properties is of fundamental importance to decide on the failure/success of a galaxy formation model.},

abstract = {The luminosity functions of galaxies of various Hubble types in the central 6° radius core of the Virgo cluster show fundamentally different forms for the high- and low-surface-brightness systems. The classical E, S0, and all of the spiral types have luminosity functions that are closely Gaussian, bounded at both the bright and faint limits, similar to what was originally proposed by Hubble. Dwarf ellipticals have an ever-increasing differential luminosity function to the completeness limit of our data at BT = 18 (MBT = - 13.7) which, when corrected for the known incompleteness to BT = 20(MBT = - 11.7), is similar to the exponential LF proposed by Zwicky. There are no dwarf spirals. Nucleated dE's exist at all magnitudes, but their percentage relative to the total dE population decreases with decreasing absolute luminosity of the parent. Gauss and Schechter LF's are fitted to the data, variously binned by Hubble types. The E and dE functions do not fit together, suggesting separate families with no continuity between them, contrary to the continuity displayed by certain integrated physical parameters (Paper I). The total luminosity of all supposed member galaxies in the central 6° core is 2.4 X 1012 blue solar luminosities. The luminosity density averaged over the 6° core is 5.6 x 1010 LBsun Mpc-3, which is 615 times larger than the mean luminosity density of the base4evel "homogeneous" universe.},

@article{Lisker2013,
abstract = {How did the dwarf galaxy population of present-day galaxy clusters form and grow over time? We address this question by analysing the history of dark matter subhaloes in the Millennium II cosmological simulation. A semi-analytic model serves as the link to observations. We argue that a reasonable analogue to early morphological types or red-sequence dwarf galaxies are those subhaloes that experienced strong mass-loss, or alternatively those that have spent a long time in massive haloes. This approach reproduces well the observed morphology-distance relation of dwarf galaxies in the Virgo and Coma clusters, and thus provides insight into their history. Over their lifetime, present-day late types have experienced an amount of environmental influence similar to what the progenitors of dwarf ellipticals had already experienced at redshifts above 2. Therefore, dwarf ellipticals are more likely to be a result of early and continuous environmental influence in group- and cluster-size haloes, rather than a recent transformation product. The observed morphological sequences of late-type and early-type galaxies have developed in parallel, not consecutively. Consequently, the characteristics of today's late-type galaxies are not necessarily representative for the progenitors of today's dwarf ellipticals. Studies aiming to reproduce the present-day dwarf population thus need to start at early epochs, model the influence of various environments, and also take into account the evolution of the environments themselves.},

abstract = {The Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys (HST/ACS) Coma Cluster Treasury Survey is a deep two-passband imaging survey of the nearest very rich cluster of galaxies, covering a range of galaxy density environments. The imaging is complemented by a recent wide field redshift survey of the cluster conducted with Hectospec on the 6.5-m Monolithic Mirror Telescope (MMT). Among the many scientific applications for these data is the search for compact galaxies. In this paper, we present the discovery of seven compact (but quite luminous) stellar systems, ranging from M32-like galaxies down to ultra-compact dwarfs (UCDs)/dwarf to globular transition objects (DGTOs).  We find that all seven compact galaxies require a two-component fit to their light profile and have measured velocity dispersions that exceed those expected for typical early-type galaxies at their luminosity. From our structural parameter analysis, we conclude that three of the samples should be classified as compact ellipticals or M32-like galaxies, and the remaining four being less extreme systems. The three compact ellipticals are all found to have old luminosity weighted ages ({\textgreater}{\~{}}12 Gyr), intermediate metallicities (-0.6 {\textless} [Fe/H] {\textless} -0.1) and high [Mg/Fe] ({\textgreater}{\~{}}0.25).  Our findings support a tidal stripping scenario as the formation mode of compact galaxies covering the luminosity range studied here. We speculate that at least two early-type morphologies may serve as the progenitor of compact galaxies in clusters.},

The resulting F606W and F814W color-magnitude diagrams are the first to reach below the main sequence turnoff in a dE galaxy, allowing us to determine full star formation histories in these systems. The ACS fields are located {\~{}}1.5 effective radii from the galaxy center to avoid photometric crowding. While our ACS pointings in both dEs show unambiguous evidence for old and intermediate age stars, the mean age in NGC 147 is {\~{}} 4 Gyr younger as compared to NGC 185. In NGC 147, only 40{\%} of stars were in place 12.5 Gyrs ago (z{\~{}}5), with the bulk of the remaining stellar population forming between 5 to 7 Gyr. In contrast, 70{\%} of stars were formed in NGC 185 field more than12.5 Gyr ago with the majority of the remaining population forming between 8 to 10 Gyr. Star formation ceased in both ACS fields at least 3 Gyr ago. Previous observations in the central regions of NGC 185 show evidence for star formation as recent as 100 Myr ago and a strong metallicity gradient with radius. We suggest that the orbit of NGC 185 has a larger pericenter as compared to NGC 147, allowing it to preserve radial gradients and maintain a small central reservoir of recycled gas. We interpret the inferred differences in star formation histories to imply an earlier infall time into the M31 environment for NGC 185 as compared to NGC 147.},

Most of the galaxies undergo significant morphological transformation, even at the outskirts of the cluster, and move through the Hubble sequence from late-type discs to dwarf spheroidals. None of the discs is completely destroyed, therefore they cannot be the progenitors of ultracompact dwarf (UCD) galaxies.

We have re-analysed the SDSS spectra, which indicate that they possess young to intermediate-age stellar populations. These two cEs provide direct evidence, a "smoking gun", for the process of tidal stripping that is believed to be the origin of M32-type galaxies. Both are in small groups with a large spiral fraction, suggesting that we may be seeing the formation of such cE galaxies in dynamically young environments.

abstract = {Ultra-compact dwarf galaxies are among the densest stellar systems in the Universe. These systems have masses of up to 2 × 10(8) solar masses, but half-light radii of just 3-50 parsecs. Dynamical mass estimates show that many such dwarfs are more massive than expected from their luminosity. It remains unclear whether these high dynamical mass estimates arise because of the presence of supermassive black holes or result from a non-standard stellar initial mass function that causes the average stellar mass to be higher than expected. Here we report adaptive optics kinematic data of the ultra-compact dwarf galaxy M60-UCD1 that show a central velocity dispersion peak exceeding 100 kilometres per second and modest rotation. Dynamical modelling of these data reveals the presence of a supermassive black hole with a mass of 2.1 × 10(7) solar masses. This is 15 per cent of the object's total mass. The high black hole mass and mass fraction suggest that M60-UCD1 is the stripped nucleus of a galaxy. Our analysis also shows that M60-UCD1's stellar mass is consistent with its luminosity, implying a large population of previously unrecognized supermassive black holes in other ultra-compact dwarf galaxies.},

abstract = {The scaling of disk galaxy rotation velocity with baryonic mass (the "Baryonic Tully-Fisher" relation, BTF) has long confounded galaxy formation models. It is steeper than the M {\~{}} V{\^{}}3 scaling relating halo virial masses and circular velocities and its zero point implies that galaxies comprise a very small fraction of available baryons. Such low galaxy formation efficiencies may in principle be explained by winds driven by evolving stars, but the tightness of the BTF relation argues against the substantial scatter expected from such vigorous feedback mechanism. We use the APOSTLE/EAGLE simulations to show that the BTF relation is well reproduced in LCDM simulations that match the size and number of galaxies as a function of stellar mass. In such models, galaxy rotation velocities are proportional to halo virial velocity and the steep velocity-mass dependence results from the decline in galaxy formation efficiency with decreasing halo mass needed to reconcile the CDM halo mass function with the galaxy luminosity function. Despite the strong feedback, the scatter in the simulated BTF is smaller than observed, even when considering all simulated galaxies and not just rotationally-supported ones. The simulations predict that the BTF should become increasingly steep at the faint end, although the velocity scatter at fixed mass should remain small. Observed galaxies with rotation speeds below {\~{}}40 km/s seem to deviate from this prediction. We discuss observational biases and modeling uncertainties that may help to explain this disagreement in the context of LCDM models of dwarf galaxy formation.},

abstract = {Cumulative number density matching of galaxies is a method to observationally connect descendent galaxies to their typical main progenitors at higher redshifts and thereby to assess the evolution of galaxy properties. The accuracy of this method is limited due to galaxy merging and scatter in the stellar mass growth history of individual galaxies. Behroozi et al. (2013) have introduced a refinement of the method, based on abundance matching of observed galaxies to the Bolshoi dark-matter-only simulation. The EAGLE cosmological hydro-simulation is well suited to test this method, because it reproduces the observed evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function and has a representative sample of passive/active galaxies. We find agreement with the Behroozi et al. (2013) method for the complete sample of main progenitors of z = 0 galaxies, but we also find a strong dependence on the current star formation rate. Passive galaxies with a stellar mass up to 10{\^{}}10.75 Msun have a completely different median mass history than active galaxies of the same mass. This difference persists if we only select central galaxies. This means that the cumulative number density method should be applied separately to active and passive galaxies. Even then, the typical main progenitor of a z = 0 galaxy already spans two orders of magnitude in stellar mass at z = 2. Any observational analysis using cumulative number density matching therefore needs to be tested on a range of simulations.},

abstract = {We relate transitions in galaxy structure and gas content to refueling, here defined to include both the external gas accretion and the internal gas processing needed to renew reservoirs for star formation. We analyze two z = 0 data sets: a high-quality {\~{}}200 galaxy sample (the Nearby Field Galaxy Survey, data release herein) and a volume-limited {\~{}}3000 galaxy sample with reprocessed archival data. Both reach down to baryonic masses {\~{}}109 M ⊙ and span void-to-cluster environments. Two mass-dependent transitions are evident: (1) below the "gas-richness threshold" scale (V {\~{}} 125 km s-1), gas-dominated quasi-bulgeless Sd-Im galaxies become numerically dominant; while (2) above the "bimodality" scale (V {\~{}} 200 km s-1), gas-starved E/S0s become the norm. Notwithstanding these transitions, galaxy mass (or V as its proxy) is a poor predictor of gas-to-stellar mass ratio M gas/M *. Instead, M gas/M * correlates well with the ratio of a galaxy's stellar mass formed in the last Gyr to its preexisting stellar mass, such that the two ratios have numerically similar values. This striking correspondence between past-averaged star formation and current gas richness implies routine refueling of star-forming galaxies on Gyr timescales. We argue that this refueling underlies the tight M gas/M * versus color correlations often used to measure "photometric gas fractions." Furthermore, the threshold and bimodality scale transitions reflect mass-dependent demographic shifts between three refueling regimes—accretion-dominated, processing-dominated, and quenched. In this picture, gas-dominated dwarfs are explained not by inefficient star formation but by overwhelming gas accretion, which fuels stellar mass doubling in lsim1 Gyr. Moreover, moderately gas-rich bulged disks such as the Milky Way are transitional, becoming abundant only in the narrow range between the threshold and bimodality scales.},

In contrast to standard pipeline photometry (e.g., SDSS), our photometry uses optimal background subtraction, avoids suppressing color gradients, and includes systematic errors. With these improvements, we measure brighter magnitudes, larger radii, bluer colors, and a real increase in scatter around the red sequence. Combining stellar masses from our photometry with the RESOLVE-A HI mass census, we create volume-limited calibrations of the photometric gas fractions (PGF) technique, which predicts gas-to-stellar mass ratios (G/S) from galaxy colors and optional additional parameters. We analyze G/S-color residuals vs. potential third parameters, finding that axial ratio is the best independent and physically meaningful third parameter. We define a "modified color" from planar fits to G/S as a function of both color and axial ratio. In the complete galaxy population, upper limits on G/S bias linear and planar fits. We therefore model the entire PGF probability density field, enabling iterative statistical modeling of upper limits and prediction of full G/S probability distributions for individual galaxies, with two-component structure for red colors. We use the RESOLVE-B 21cm census to test several PGF calibrations, finding that most systematically under- or overestimate gas masses, but the full probability density method performs well.},

abstract = {M32 is the prototype for the relatively rare class of galaxies referred to as compact ellipticals. It has been suggested that M32 may be a tidally disturbed r1/4 elliptical galaxy or the remnant bulge of a disk-stripped early-type spiral galaxy. This Letter reveals that the surface brightness profile, the velocity dispersion measurements, and the estimated supermassive black hole mass in M32 are inconsistent with the galaxy having, and probably ever having had, an r1/4 light profile. Instead, the radial surface brightness distribution of M32 resembles an almost perfect (bulge+exponential disk) profile; this is accompanied by a marked increase in the ellipticity profile and an associated change in the position angle profile where the ``disk'' starts to dominate. Compelling evidence that this bulge/disk interpretation is accurate comes from the best-fitting r1/n bulge model, which has a S{\'{e}}rsic index of n=1.5, in agreement with the recently discovered relation between a bulge's S{\'{e}}rsic index and the mass of a bulge's supermassive black hole. An index of n{\textgreater}=4 would also be inconsistent with the stellar velocity dispersion of M32. The bulge-to-disk size ratio re/h equals 0.20, and the logarithm of the bulge-to-disk luminosity ratio log(B/D) equals 0.22, typical of S$\phi$ galaxies. The effective radius of the bulge is 27" ({\~{}}100 pc), while the scale length of the disk is less well determined: owing to possible tidal stripping of the outer profile beyond 220"-250", the scale length may be as large as 1.3 kpc. M32 is a relatively face-on, nucleated dwarf galaxy with a low surface brightness disk and a high surface brightness bulge. This finding brings into question the very existence of the compact elliptical class of galaxies.},

abstract = {We track subhalo orbits of galaxy and group sized halos in cosmological simulations. We identify filamentary structures around halos and we use these to define a sample of subhalos accreted from filaments as well as a control sample of subhalos accreted from other directions. We use these samples to study differences in satellite orbits produced by filamentary accretion. Our results depend on host halo mass. We find that for low masses, subhalos accreted from filaments show {\$}\backslashsim10\backslash{\%}{\$} shorter lifetimes compared to the control sample, they have more radial orbits, reach halo central regions earlier, and are more likely to merge with the host. For higher mass halos this lifetime difference dissipates and even reverses for cluster sized halos. This behavior appears to be connected to the fact that more massive hosts are connected to stronger filaments with higher velocity coherence and density, with more radial subhalo orbits. Because subhalos tend to follow the coherent flow of the filament, it is possible that such thick filaments are enough to shield the subhalo from the effect of dynamical friction at least during their first infall. We also identify subhalo pairs/clumps which merge with one another after accretion. They survive as a clump for only a very short time, which is even shorter for higher subhalo masses. There is a {\$}50\backslash{\%}{\$} and {\$}90\backslash{\%}{\$} chance they were accreted in the last {\$}0.8{\$}Gyr and {\$}3.4{\$}Gyr respectively. This suggests that the Magellanic Clouds and other Local group satellite associations, may have entered the MW virial radius very recently and probably are in their first infall -- or at least still in their first full orbit. Filaments boost the accretion of satellite associations.},

We show that the UDG population represents the tail of galaxies formed in dwarf-sized haloes with higher-than-average angular momentum at collapse. By adopting the standard model of disk formation -- in which the size of galaxies is set by the spin of the halo -- we recover both the abundance of UDGs as a function of the host cluster mass and the distribution of sizes within the UDG population. According to this model, UDGs are not failed {\$}L{\_}*{\$} galaxies, but genuine dwarfs, and their low SB is not uniquely connected to the harsh cluster environment. We therefore expect a correspondingly abundant population of UDGs in the field, with likely different morphologies and colours.},

Also, gas-poor dwarf elliptical galaxies are often found in the central regions of clusters of galaxies. These observations suggest strongly that the formation of most dwarf galaxies is linked to galaxy interactions. Therefore, now seems like the right time to investigate the formation efficiency of such tidal dwarf galaxies. Adopting the galaxy interaction scenario proposed by Silk {\&} Norman, we find that if only a few dwarf galaxies are formed in each galaxy collision, we are able to explain the observed morphology-density relations for both dwarf and giant galaxies in the field, groups of galaxies, and clusters of galaxies. It seems worthwhile noting that the tidal dwarf formation may be coupled with the transformation from gas-rich disk galaxies to early-type galaxies such as S0 and elliptical galaxies.},

All six dEs follow the size-magnitude relation for dE/dSph galaxies. Central velocity dispersions are measured for three Perseus dwarfs in our sample, and all lie on the $\sigma$-luminosity relation for early-type, pressure-supported systems. We furthermore examine SA 0426-002, a unique dE in our sample with a bar-like morphology surrounded by low surface brightness wings/lobes ($\mu$B = 27 mag arcsec-2). Given its morphology, velocity dispersion ($\sigma$0 = 33.9 ± 6.1 km s-1), velocity relative to the brightest cluster galaxy NGC 1275 (2711 km s-1), size (Re = 2.1 ± 0.10 kpc), and S{\'{e}}rsic index (n = 1.2 ± 0.02), we hypothesize the dwarf has morphologically transformed from a low-mass disc to dE via harassment. The low surface brightness lobes can be explained as a ring feature, with the bar formation triggered by tidal interactions via speed encounters with Perseus Cluster members. Alongside spiral structure found in dEs in Fornax and Virgo, SA 0426-002 provides crucial evidence that a fraction of bright dEs have a disc infall origin, and are not part of the primordial cluster population.},

abstract = {New surface photometry of all known elliptical galaxies in the Virgo cluster is added to published data to derive composite profiles over large dynamic ranges. Sersic functions fit them remarkably well. Effective brightnesses and radii are derived via Sersic fits and by integrating the profiles nonparametrically. We strongly confirm two dichotomies: (1) Elliptical galaxies from cDs to M32 form a tight sequence in Fundamental Plane parameter space that is almost perpendicular to the sequence of spheroidal galaxies from NGC 205 to Draco. This is consistent with our understanding of their different formation processes: mergers for Es and conversion of late-type galaxies into spheroidals by environmental effects and by energy feedback from supernovae. (2) Ellipticals come in two varieties: e.g., our 10 brightest Es have cuspy cores; our 17 fainter Es do not have cores. We find a new distinct component in coreless Es. All have extra light at the center above the inward extrapolation of the outer Sersic profile. We suggest that extra light is made by starbursts in dissipational (wet) mergers, as in numerical simulations. Three other new aspects also point to an explanation of how the E-E dichotomy formed: extra light Es were made in wet mergers while core Es were made in dry mergers. We confirm that core Es do and extra light Es generally do not contain X-ray gas. This suggests why the E-E dichotomy arose. Only core Es and their progenitors are massive enough to retain hot gas that can make dry mergers dry and protect old star populations from late star formation.},

abstract = {We investigate the properties of star formation-driven outflows by using a large spectroscopic sample of {\~{}}160,000 local "normal" star forming galaxies, drawn from the SDSS, spanning a wide range of star formation rates and stellar masses. The galaxy sample is divided into a fine grid of bins in the M{\_}*-SFR parameter space, for each of which we produce a composite spectrum by stacking together the SDSS spectra of the galaxies contained in that bin. We exploit the high signal-to-noise of the stacked spectra to study the emergence of faint features of optical emission lines that may trace galactic outflows and would otherwise be too faint to detect in individual galaxy spectra. We adopt a novel approach that relies on the comparison between the line-of-sight velocity distribution (LoSVD) of the ionised gas (as traced by the [OIII]5007 and Halpha+[NII]6548,6583 emission lines) and the LoSVD of the stars, which are used as a reference tracing virial motions. Significant deviations of the gas kinematics from the stellar kinematics in the high velocity tail of the LoSVDs are interpreted as a signature of outflows. Our results suggest that the incidence of ionised outflows increases with SFR and sSFR. The outflow velocity (v{\_}out) correlates tightly with the SFR for SFR{\textgreater}1 M{\_}Sun/yr, whereas at lower SFRs the dependence of v{\_}out on SFR is nearly flat. The outflow velocity, although with a much larger scatter, increases also with the stellar velocity dispersion, and we infer velocities as high as v{\_}out{\~{}}(6-8)*sigma{\_}stars. Strikingly, we detect the signature of ionised outflows only in galaxies located above the main sequence (MS) of star forming galaxies in the M{\_}*-SFR diagram, and the incidence of such outflows increases sharply with the offset from the MS. Our complementary analysis of the stellar kinematics reveals the presence of blue asymmetries of a few 10 km/s in the stellar LoSVDs. [abridged]},

We analyzed deep F475W (Sloan g) and F814W (I) Hubble Space Telescope images obtained with the Advanced Camera for Surveys Wide Field Channel as part of the Coma Cluster Treasury Survey and have fitted the light profiles of {\~{}}5000 point-like sources in the vicinity of NGC 4874, one of the two central dominant galaxies of the Coma Cluster. Although almost all of these sources are globular clusters that remain unresolved, we found that 52 objects have effective radii between {\~{}}10 and 66 pc, in the range spanned by dwarf globular transition objects (DGTOs) and UCDs. Of these 52 compact objects, 25 are brighter than MV {\~{}} -11 mag, a magnitude conventionally thought to separate UCDs and globular clusters. The UCD/DGTO candidates have the same color and luminosity distribution as the most luminous globular clusters within the red and blue subpopulations of the immensely rich NGC 4874 globular cluster system. Unlike standard globular clusters, blue and red UCD/DGTO subpopulations have the same median effective radius. The spatial distribution of UCD/DGTO candidates reveals that they congregate toward NGC 4874 and are not uniformly distributed. We find a relative deficit of UCD/DGTOs compared with globular clusters in the inner 15 kpc around NGC 4874 however, at larger radii UCD/DGTO and globular clusters follow the same spatial distribution.  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555. These observations are associated with program 10861.},

abstract = {The recent discovery of hidden non-axysimmetric and disk-like structures in bright Virgo dwarf elliptical and lenticular galaxies (dE/dSph/dS0) indicates that they may have late-type progenitors. Using N-body simulations we follow the evolution of disk galaxies within a LambdaCDM cluster simulated with 10e7 particles, where the hierarchical growth and galaxy harassment are modeled self-consistently. Most of the galaxies undergo significant morphological transformation, even at the outskirts of the cluster, and move through the Hubble sequence from late type disks to dwarf spheroidals. None of the disks are completely destroyed therefore they can not be the progenitors of ultra compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs). The time evolution of the simulated galaxies is compared with unsharp-masked images obtained from VLT data and the projected kinematics of our models with the latest high resolution spectroscopic studies from the Keck and Palomar telescopes.},

abstract = {Keck/ESI spectroscopy is presented for six Virgo Cluster dwarf elliptical (dE) galaxies. The mean line-of-sight velocity and velocity dispersion are resolved as a function of radius along the major axis of each galaxy, nearly doubling the total number of dEs with spatially-resolved stellar kinematics. None of the observed objects shows evidence of strong rotation: upper limits on v{\_}rot/sigma are well below those expected for rotationally-flattened objects. Such limits place strong constraints on dE galaxy formation models. Although these galaxies continue the trend of low rotation velocities observed in Local Group dEs, they are in contrast to recent observations of large rotation velocities in slightly brighter cluster dEs. Using WFPC2 surface photometry and spherically-symmetric dynamical models, we determine global mass-to-light ratios 3 {\textless} M/L{\_}V {\textless} 6. These ratios are comparable to those expected for an intermediate-age stellar population and are broadly consistent with the (V-I) colors of the galaxies. This implies that these dEs do not have a significant dark matter component inside an effective radius. Central black holes more massive than 10{\^{}}7 M{\_}sun can be ruled out. For the 5 nucleated dEs in our sample, we determine kinematic and photometric properties for the central nucleus separately from the underlying host dE galaxy. These nuclei are as bright or brighter than the most luminous Galactic globular clusters and lie near the region of Fundamental Plane space occupied by globular clusters. In this space, the Virgo dE galaxies lie in the same general region as Local Group and other nearby dEs, although non-rotating dEs appear to have a slightly higher mean mass and mass-to-light ratio than their rotating counterparts.},

abstract = {The Zwicky Catalog of galaxies (ZC), with m{\_}Zw{\textless}=15.5mag, has been the basis for the Center for Astrophysics (CfA) redshift surveys. To date, analyses of the ZC and redshift surveys based on it have relied on heterogeneous sets of galaxy coordinates and redshifts. Here we correct some of the inadequacies of previous catalogs by providing: (1) coordinates with {\textless}{\~{}}2 arcsec errors for all of the Nuzc catalog galaxies, (2) homogeneously estimated redshifts for the majority (98{\%}) of the data taken at the CfA (14,632 spectra), and (3) an estimate of the remaining "blunder" rate for both the CfA redshifts and for those compiled from the literature. For the reanalyzed CfA data we include a calibrated, uniformly determined error and an indication of the presence of emission lines in each spectrum. We provide redshifts for 7,257 galaxies in the CfA2 redshift survey not previously published; for another 5,625 CfA redshifts we list the remeasured or uniformly re-reduced value. Among our new measurements, Nmul are members of UZC "multiplets" associated with the original Zwicky catalog position in the coordinate range where the catalog is 98{\%} complete. These multiplets provide new candidates for examination of tidal interactions among galaxies. All of the new redshifts correspond to UZC galaxies with properties recorded in the CfA redshift compilation known as ZCAT. About 1,000 of our new measurements were motivated either by inadequate signal-to-noise in the original spectrum or by an ambiguous identification of the galaxy associated with a ZCAT redshift. The redshift catalog we include here is {\~{}}96{\%} complete to m{\_}Zw{\textless}=15.5, and {\~{}}98{\%} complete (12,925 galaxies out of a total of 13,150) for the RA(1950) ranges [20h--4h] and [8h--17h] and DEC(1950) range [-2.5d--50d].

abstract = {The relation between galaxies and dark matter halos reflects the combined effects of many distinct physical processes. Observations indicate that the {\$}z=0{\$} stellar mass-halo mass (SMHM) relation has remarkably small scatter in stellar mass at fixed halo mass ({\$}\backslashlesssim{\$} 0.2 dex) with little dependence on halo mass. We investigate the origins of this scatter by combining N-body simulations with observational constraints on the SMHM relation. We find that at the group and cluster scale ({\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm vir{\}}{\textgreater}10{\^{}}{\{}14{\}}{\{}M{\_}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}) the scatter due purely to hierarchical assembly is {\$}\backslashapprox0.16{\$} dex, which is comparable to recent direct observational estimates. At lower masses, mass buildup since {\$}z\backslashapprox2{\$} is driven largely by in-situ growth. We include a model for the in-situ buildup of stellar mass and find that an intrinsic scatter in this growth channel of {\$}0.2{\$} dex produces a relation between scatter and halo mass that is consistent with observations from {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}12{\}}{\{}M{\_}\backslashodot{\}}{\textless}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm vir{\}}{\textless}10{\^{}}{\{}14.75{\}}{\{}M{\_}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}. The approximately constant scatter across a wide range of halo masses at {\$}z=0{\$} thus appears to be a coincidence as it is determined largely by in-situ growth at low masses and by hierarchical assembly at high masses. These results indicate that the scatter in the SMHM relation can provide unique insight into the regularity of the galaxy formation process.},

abstract = {The authors study some aspects of the evolution of compact M32-type elliptical galaxies (cEs) during their orbital decay onto a massive neighbour. For a typical cE, they find a very slow orbital decay rate: about a few kpc per 109yr. The present mass loss is small, ≡1 - 10 M{\_}sun;/year. The merging of cEs into their massive neighbour should happen within 109 and 1010yr. The small mass loss during the decay implies that progenitors of cEs had already a low-mass when they arose in the vicinity of the massive neighbour, either as formed there or after being captured by it. The authors argue that, in the capture case also, the progenitors were formed with a low mass, ranging between a few times 109 and a few times 1010M{\_}sun;. This gives strong support for cEs to be related to the low mass end of the luminosity function of elliptical galaxies: in particular, cEs could not have evolved from massive ellipticals via tidal stripping. Therefore isolated low-mass ellipticals should exist, that resemble cEs.},

abstract = {Deep observations of galaxies reveal faint extended stellar components (hereafter ESCs) of streams, shells, and halos. These are a natural prediction of hierarchical galaxy formation, as accreted satellite galaxies are tidally disrupted by their host. We investigate whether or not global properties of the ESC could be used to test of dark matter, reasoning that they should be sensitive to the abundance of low-mass satellites, and therefore the underlying dark matter model. Using cosmological simulations of galaxy formation in the favoured Cold Dark Matter (CDM) and Warm Dark Matter (WDM) models ({\$}m{\_}{\{}\backslashrm WDM{\}}{\$}=0.5,1,2 keV/{\$}c{\^{}}2{\$}), which suppress the abundance of low-mass satellites, we find that the kinematics and orbital structure of the ESC is consistent across models. However, we find striking differences in its spatial structure, as anticipated -- a factor of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}10 drop in spherically averaged mass density between {\$}\backslashsim{\$}10{\%} and {\$}\backslashsim{\$}75{\%} of the virial radius in the more extreme WDM runs ({\$}m{\_}{\{}\backslashrm WDM{\}}{\$}=0.5, 1 keV/{\$}c{\^{}}2{\$}) relative to the CDM run. These differences are consistent with the mass assembly histories of the different components, and are present across redshifts. However, even the least discrepant of the WDM models is incompatible with current observational limits on {\$}m{\_}{\{}\backslashrm WDM{\}}{\$}. Importantly, the differences we observe when varying the underlying dark matter are comparable to the galaxy-to-galaxy variation we expect within a fixed dark matter model. This suggests that it will be challenging to place limits on dark matter using only the unresolved spatial structure of the the ESC.},

Results: Based on CFHT and HST imaging we show that the light profile of A496cE requires a two component fit: a Sersic bulge and an exponential disc. The spectrum of A496cE obtained with the ESO-VLT FLAMES/Giraffe spectrograph can be fit by a stellar synthesis spectrum dominated by old stars, with high values of [Mg/Fe] and velocity dispersion. Conclusions: The capture of A496cE by the cD galaxy and tidal stripping of most of its disc are briefly discussed.},

Galaxies were modelled with S{\'{e}}rsic profiles, using both 1D $\chi$2 and 2D cross-correlation methods, with nuclei modelled as point sources. The intensity profiles of 50 galaxies previously classified as dE, dE?, or ? are more accurately fitted if a nucleus is included, and this results in the majority of dwarfs now being classified as nucleated dwarf ellipticals (dE,N). Some faint galaxies with B magnitudes of 18-21 have particularly large relative nuclei, while a small number have apparent central dimmings. For cluster dE,N galaxies the nucleus magnitude is correlated with the magnitude of the host galaxy. The profile parameters of dE and dE,N galaxies are not significantly different, and there is no evident discontinuity in relative nucleus size between non-nucleated and nucleated dwarfs, suggesting that they may form a continuum. Nuclei are on average redder than their underlying galaxies, though a spread of relative colours was found, and two-fifths of nuclei are bluer. Formation mechanisms of nuclei are discussed: at least some appear to have formed in an already existing non-nucleated galaxy, though others may have formed simultaneously with their galaxies and subsequently evolved within them.},

We quantify galaxy environments using both group identification and smoothed galaxy density field methods. We use by-eye and quantitative morphological classifications plus atomic gas content measurements and estimates. We find that blue early-type (E/S0) galaxies, gas-dominated galaxies, and UV-bright disk host galaxies all become distinctly more common below group halo mass {\~{}}10{\^{}}11.5 Msun, implying that this low group halo mass regime may be a preferred regime for significant disk growth activity. We also find that blue early-type and blue late-type galaxies inhabit environments of similar group halo mass at fixed baryonic mass, consistent with a scenario in which blue early types can regrow late-type disks. In fact, we find that the only significant difference in the typical group halo mass inhabited by different galaxy classes is for satellite galaxies with different colors, where at fixed baryonic mass red early and late types have higher typical group halo masses than blue early and late types. More generally, we argue that the traditional morphology-environment relation (i.e., that denser environments tend to have more early types) can be largely attributed to the morphology-galaxy mass relation for centrals and the color-environment relation for satellites.},

abstract = {We present the discovery of several Ultra Compact Dwarfs (UCDs) located in field/group environments. Examination of these objects, plus literature objects, confirms the existence of two distinct formation channels for UCDs. We find that the UCDs we have discovered around the group elliptical NGC3923 (and UCDs generally) have properties consistent with their being the most luminous members of the host galaxy's globular cluster (GC) system. We describe UCDs of this type as giant GCs (GGCs). In contrast, the UCD we have found associated with the isolated S0 NGC4546 is clearly the result of the stripping of a nucleated companion galaxy. The young age ({\~{}}3.4 Gyr) of the UCD, the lack of a correspondingly young GC population, the apparently short dynamical friction decay timescale ({\~{}}0.5 Gyr) of the UCD, and the presence of a counterrotating gas disc in the host galaxy (co-rotating with the UCD) together suggest that this UCD is the liberated nucleus remaining after the recent stripping of a companion by NGC4546. We suggest a general scheme that unifies the formation of GCs, UCDs, and galaxy nuclei. In this picture "normal" GCs are a composite population, composed of GCs formed in situ, GCs acquired from accreted galaxies, and a population of lower mass stripped dwarf nuclei masquerading as GCs. Above a "scaling onset mass" of 2x10{\^{}}6 Msun (Mv {\~{}} -10), UCDs emerge together with a mass-size relation and a likely mass-metallicity relation (the "blue tilt"). In the mass range up to 7x10{\^{}}7 Msun (Mv {\~{}} -13) UCDs comprise a composite population of GGCs and stripped nuclei. Above 7x10{\^{}}7 Msun, UCDs must be almost exclusively stripped nuclei, as no sufficiently rich GC systems exist to populate such an extreme of the GCLF.},

abstract = {We identify a population of morphologically defined E/S0 galaxies lying on the locus of late-type galaxies in color-stellar mass space—the "blue sequence"—at the present epoch. Using three samples (from the Nearby Field Galaxy Survey or NFGS, a merged HyperLeda/Sloan Digital Sky Survey/Two Micron All Sky Survey catalog, and the NYU Value-Added Galaxy Catalog), we analyze blue-sequence E/S0s with stellar masses gsim108 M sun, arguing that individual objects may be evolving either up toward the red sequence or down into the blue sequence. Blue-sequence E/S0 galaxies become more common with decreasing stellar mass, comprising lsim2{\%} of E/S0s near the "shutdown mass" Ms {\~{}} 1-2 × 1011 M sun, increasing to gsim5{\%} near the "bimodality mass" Mb {\~{}} 3 × 1010 M sun, and sharply rising to gsim 20{\%}-30{\%} below the "threshold mass" Mt {\~{}} 4-6 × 109 M sun, down to our completeness analysis limit at {\~{}}109 M sun. The strong emergence of blue-sequence E/S0s below Mt coincides with a previously reported global increase in mean atomic gas fractions below Mt for galaxies of all types on both sequences, suggesting that the availability of cold gas may be basic to blue-sequence E/S0s' existence. Environmental analysis reveals that many sub-Mb blue-sequence E/S0s reside in low-to-intermediate density environments. Thus, the bulk of the population we analyze appears distinct from the generally lower-mass cluster dE population; S0 morphologies with a range of bulge sizes are typical. In mass-radius and mass-$\sigma$ scaling relations, blue-sequence E/S0s are more similar to red-sequence E/S0s than to late-type galaxies, but they represent a transitional class. While some of them, especially in the high-mass range from Mb to Ms , resemble major-merger remnants that will likely fade onto the red sequence, most blue-sequence E/S0s below Mb show signs of disk and/or pseudobulge building, which may be enhanced by companion interactions. The blue overall colors of blue-sequence E/S0s are most clearly linked to blue outer disks, but also reflect blue centers and more frequent blue-centered color gradients than seen in red-sequence E/S0s. Notably, all E/S0s in the NFGS with polar or counterrotating gas lie on or near the blue sequence, and most of these systems show signs of secondary stellar disks forming in the decoupled gas. From star formation rates and gas fractions, we infer significant recent and ongoing morphological transformation in the blue-sequence E/S0 population, especially below Mb . We argue that sub-Mb blue-sequence E/S0s occupy a "sweet spot" in stellar mass and concentration, with both abundant gas and optimally efficient star formation, which may enable the formation of large spiral disks. Our results provide evidence for the importance of disk rebuilding after mergers, as predicted by hierarchical models of galaxy formation.},

abstract = {We describe the calibration status and data products pertaining to the GR2 and GR3 data releases of the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX). These releases have identical pipeline calibrations that are significantly improved over the GR1 data release. GALEX continues to survey the sky in the far-ultraviolet (FUV, {\~{}}154 nm) and near-ultraviolet (NUV, {\~{}}232 nm) bands, providing simultaneous imaging with a pair of photon-counting, microchannel plate, delay line readout detectors. These 1.25° field of view detectors are well suited to ultraviolet observations because of their excellent red rejection and negligible background. A dithered mode of observing and photon list output pose complex requirements on the data processing pipeline, entangling detector calibrations, and aspect reconstruction algorithms. Recent improvements have achieved photometric repeatability of 0.05 and 0.03 mAB in the FUV and NUV, respectively. We have detected a long-term drift of order 1{\%} FUV and 6{\%} NUV over the mission. Astrometric precision is of order 0.5" rms in both bands. In this paper we provide the GALEX user with a broad overview of the calibration issues likely to be confronted in the current release. Improvements are likely as the GALEX mission continues into an extended phase with a healthy instrument, no consumables, and increased opportunities for guest investigations.},

abstract = {The relation between the size and luminosity for both bright and faint early-type galaxies has been repeatedly discussed as a crucial proxy for understanding evolutionary scenarios, as galaxies grow and lose their stellar mass in different physical processes. The class of compact early-type galaxies (cEs) are, however, distinct outliers from this relation and mainly found around massive galaxies in the centres of groups and clusters. The recent discovery of a cE in isolation provided a new opportunity to understand their formation scenario in a different environment. Here, we report the discovery of an isolated cE, CGCG 036-042, using imagery from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The CGCG 036-042 has an {\$}r{\$}-band absolute magnitude (M{\$}{\_}{\{}r{\}}{\$}) of {\$}-{\$}18.21 mag and a half-light radius (R{\$}{\_}{\{}e{\}}{\$}) of 559 pc. Interestingly, it possesses a faint outer stellar component, which extends up to 10 kpc from its centre and has a nearly constant {\$}r{\$}-band surface brightness of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}26 mag/arcsec{\$}{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}{\$}. ESO-VLT long-slit spectroscopic data reveal that the simple stellar population (SSP) properties are fairly similar to those of previously identified cEs, with an intermediate-age of 7.15{\$}\backslashpm{\$}1.17 Gyr, a metallicity of --0.18{\$}\backslashpm{\$}0.07 dex and a supersolar alpha-element abundance of 0.2{\$}\backslashpm{\$}0.05 dex. The SSP metallicity also shows a significant decline outward from the center, by 0.5 dex over one half light radius. We discuss the possible origin of this galaxy and suggest that it might have originated from a merger of even smaller objects -- a well established scenario for the formation of massive early-type galaxies.},

abstract = {We investigate the interaction history of the M31 subgroup by comparing surface photometry of two of its satellites, M32 and NGC 205, with N-body simulations of satellite destruction. The recent discovery of a giant stream in the outer halo of M31, apparently pointed in the direction of M32 and NGC 205, makes such an investigation particularly relevant. The observational component of this study is based on 1.7d×5° B- and I-band CCD mosaic images centered on M31 and covering both satellites. Standard ellipse-fitting techniques are used to model and remove M31 disk light and to perform surface photometry on the satellites to limiting brightness levels of ($\mu$B,$\mu$I)=(27,25) mag arcsec-2, corresponding to isophotal semimajor axis lengths of rM32lim=420'' (1.6 kpc) and rNGC205lim=720" (2.7 kpc). A hint of excess light in the outer parts of M32 noted in earlier studies is confirmed; in particular, clear evidence is seen for a sharp (upward) break in the surface brightness profile at r=150" relative to a r1/4 law that fits the inner region of M32. This break is accompanied by a steep increase in isophotal ellipticity ɛ, as well as position angle $\phi$' twisting. In addition to this excess, evidence is seen for an inner downward break in the surface brightness profile at r=50". The robustness of the M32 isophotal features is demonstrated through their (1) insensitivity to the details of background subtraction, (2) symmetry about M32's center, and (3) narrow range of B-I color that is consistent with the interior regions of M32 but not with M31 residual spiral arm/dust lane features. The study of NGC 205 reveals pronounced isophote twisting at r{\~{}}300" that is coincident with a subtle downward break in the surface brightness profile, relative to an exponential law fitted to the inner region. The simulation component of this project is based on the analysis of single-component, spherical satellites that are being tidally disrupted through interactions with their parent galaxy. Generic features of the simulations include an excess in the surface brightness profile at large radii, a depletion zone at intermediate radii, and isophotal elongation and twists that are coincident with breaks in the brightness profile. The two satellites, M32 and NGC 205, display most of these features consistently across the B and I bands, which is strongly suggestive of tidal interaction and probable stripping by M31. We discuss what these observed features can tell us about the satellites' orbital parameters and histories. Specifically, M32 is found to be on a highly eccentric orbit and away from pericenter. Investigating M32's unusual combination of high surface brightness and low luminosity (the hallmark of compact ellipticals), we make empirical estimates of the galaxy's intrinsic properties and conclude that it is not likely to be the residual core of a tidally stripped normal elliptical galaxy, as has been suggested, but rather that its precursor was intrinsically compact. Observations carried out at the Kitt Peak National Observatory, National Optical Astronomy Observatory, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation.},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce the Local Volume TiNy Titans sample (LV-TNT), which is a part of a larger body of work on interacting dwarf galaxies: TNT (Stierwalt et al. 2015). This LV-TNT sample consists of 10 dwarf galaxy pairs in the Local Universe ({\textless} 30 Mpc from Milky Way), which span mass ratios of M{\_}(*,1)/M{\_}(*,2) {\textless} 20, projected separations {\textless} 100 kpc, and pair member masses of log(M{\_}*/M{\_}Sun) {\textless} 9.9. All 10 LV-TNT pairs have resolved synthesis maps of their neutral hydrogen, are located in a range of environments and captured at various interaction stages. This enables us to do a comparative study of the diffuse gas in dwarf-dwarf interactions and disentangle the gas lost due to interactions with halos of massive galaxies, from the gas lost due to mutual interaction between the dwarfs. We find that the neutral gas is extended in the interacting pairs when compared to non-paired analogs, indicating that gas is tidally pre-processed. Additionally, we find that the environment can shape the HI distributions in the form of trailing tails and that the gas is not unbound and lost to the surroundings unless the dwarf pair is residing near a massive galaxy. We conclude that a nearby, massive host galaxy is what ultimately prevents the gas from being reaccreted. Dwarf-dwarf interactions thus represent an important part of the baryon cycle of low mass galaxies, enabling the "parking" of gas at large distances to serve as a continual gas supply channel until accretion by a more massive host.},

abstract = {Results are reported from an analysis of the structural properties of dynamically hot galaxies which combines central velocity dispersion, effective surface brightness, and effective radius into a new 3-space (k), in which the axes are parameters that are physically meaningful. Hot galaxies are found to divide into groups in k-space that closely parallel conventional morphological classifications, namely, luminous ellipticals, compacts, bulges, bright dwarfs, and dwarf spheroidals. A major sequence is defined by luminous ellipticals, bulges, and most compacts, which together constitute a smooth continuum in k-space. Several properties vary smoothly with mass along this continuum, including bulge-to-disk ratio, radio properties, rotation, degree of velocity anisotropy, and 'unrelaxed'. A second major sequence is comprised of dwarf ellipticals and dwarf spheroidals. It is suggested that mass loss is a major factor in hot dwarf galaxies, but the dwarf sequence cannot be simply a mass-loss sequence, as it has the wrong direction in k-space.},

abstract = {Radial velocities of 94 galaxies brighter than about V{\_}tot = 20 mag in the direction of the central Fornax cluster have been measured.   Except for 8 Fornax members, all galaxies lie in the background. Among the 8 members, there are 5 nucleated dwarf ellipticals that are already listed in the FCC ($\backslash$cite[Ferguson 1989]{\{}ferg89{\}}). Two of the 3 ``new'' members are very compact and have surface brightnesses comparable to globular clusters, however their luminosities are in the range of dwarf elliptical nuclei. The measured line indices (especially Mg2, H$\beta$ , and iron) of the brighter of the compact objects suggest a solar metallicity, whereas the fainter compact object as well as the dE, Ns have line indices that are similar to those of old metal-poor globular clusters (GCs). However, with these data it is not possible to clearly classify the compact objects either as very bright globular clusters, isolated nuclei of dE, Ns, or even compact ellipticals. A background galaxy cluster at z = 0.11 has been found just behind the center of the Fornax cluster. This explains the excess population of galaxies reported in Paper I. The brightest galaxy of the background cluster lies only 1farcm1 south of NGC 1399 and is comparable in absolute luminosity with the central Fornax galaxy itself.

abstract = {We study the origin of high-redshift, compact, quenched spheroids (red nuggets) through the dissipative shrinkage of gaseous discs into compact star-forming systems (blue nuggets). The discs, fed by cold streams, undergo violent disc instability that drives gas into the centre (along with mergers). The inflow is dissipative when its time-scale is shorter than the star formation time-scale. This implies a threshold of ˜0.28 in the cold-to-total mass ratio within the disc radius. For the typical gas fraction ˜0.5 at z ˜ 2, this threshold is traced back to a maximum spin parameter of ˜0.05, implying that ˜half the star-forming galaxies contract to blue nuggets, while the rest form extended stellar discs. Thus, the surface density of blue galaxies is expected to be bimodal about ˜109 M⊙ kpc-2, slightly increasing with mass. The blue nuggets are expected to be rare at low z when the gas fraction is low. The blue nuggets quench to red nuggets by complementary internal and external mechanisms. Internal quenching by a compact bulge, in a fast mode and especially at high z, may involve starbursts, stellar and active galactic nucleus feedback, or Q-quenching. Quenching due to hot-medium haloes above 1012 M⊙ provides maintenance and a slower mode at low redshift. These predictions are confirmed in simulations and are consistent with observations at z = 0-3.},

abstract = {We present {\$}{\^{}}{\{}12{\}}{\$}CO(1-0) and {\$}{\^{}}{\{}12{\}}{\$}CO(2-1) observations of a sample of 20 star-forming dwarfs selected from the Herschel Virgo Cluster Survey, with oxygen abundances ranging from 12 + log(O/H) {\~{}} 8.1 to 8.8. CO emission is observed in ten galaxies and marginally detected in another one. CO fluxes correlate with the FIR 250 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}m emission, and the dwarfs follow the same linear relation that holds for more massive spiral galaxies extended to a wider dynamical range. We compare different methods to estimate H2 molecular masses, namely a metallicity-dependent CO-to-H2 conversion factor and one dependent on H-band luminosity. The molecular-to-stellar mass ratio remains nearly constant at stellar masses {\textless}{\~{}} 10{\$}{\^{}}9{\$} M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}, contrary to the atomic hydrogen fraction, M{\$}{\_}{\{}HI{\}}{\$}/M{\$}{\_}*{\$}, which increases inversely with M{\$}{\_}*{\$}. The flattening of the M{\$}{\_}{\{}H{\_}2{\}}{\$}/M{\$}{\_}*{\$} ratio at low stellar masses does not seem to be related to the effects of the cluster environment because it occurs for both HI-deficient and HI-normal dwarfs. The molecular-to-atomic ratio is more tightly correlated with stellar surface density than metallicity, confirming that the interstellar gas pressure plays a key role in determining the balance between the two gaseous components of the interstellar medium. Virgo dwarfs follow the same linear trend between molecular gas mass and star formation rate as more massive spirals, but gas depletion timescales, {\$}\backslashtau{\_}{\{}dep{\}}{\$}, are not constant and range between 100 Myr and 6 Gyr. The interaction with the Virgo cluster environment is removing the atomic gas and dust components of the dwarfs, but the molecular gas appears to be less affected at the current stage of evolution within the cluster. However, the correlation between HI deficiency and the molecular gas depletion time suggests that the lack of gas replenishment from the outer regions of the disc is lowering the star formation activity.},

Several objects are close analogues to the prototypical cE, M32. These objects, which are more massive than previously discovered UCDs of the same size, further call into question the existence of a tight mass-size trend for compact stellar systems, while simultaneously strengthening the case for a universal "zone of avoidance" for dynamically hot stellar systems in the mass-size plane.   Overall, we argue that there are two classes of compact stellar systems: 1) massive star clusters and 2) a population closely related to galaxies. Our data provide indications for a further division of the galaxy-type UCD/cE population into two groups, one population that we associate with objects formed by the stripping of nucleated dwarf galaxies, and a second population that formed through the stripping of bulged galaxies or are lower-mass analogues of classical ellipticals. We find compact stellar systems around galaxies in low to high density environments, demonstrating that the physical processes responsible for forming them do not only operate in the densest clusters.},

@article{Maraston2011,
abstract = {We present new, high-to-intermediate spectral resolution stellar population models, based on four popular libraries of empirical stellar spectra, namely Pickles, ELODIE, STELIB and MILES. These new models are the same as our previous models, but with higher resolution and based on empirical stellar spectra, while keeping other ingredients the same including the stellar energetics, the atmospheric parameters and the treatment of the thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch and the horizontal branch morphology. We further compute very high resolution (R= 20 000) models based on the theoretical stellar library MARCS which extends to the near-infrared. We therefore provide merged high-resolution stellar population models, extending from ˜1000 to 25 000 {\AA}, using our previously published high-resolution theoretical models which extended to the ultraviolet. We compare how these libraries perform in stellar population models and highlight spectral regions where discrepancies are found. We confirm our previous findings that the flux around the V band is lower (in a normalized sense) in models based on empirical libraries than in those based on the BaSeL-Kurucz library, which results in a bluer B-V colour. Most noticeably the theoretical library MARCS gives results fully consistent with the empirical libraries. This same effect is also found in other models using MILES, namely Vazdekis et al. and Conroy {\&} Gunn, even though the latter authors reach the opposite conclusion. The bluer predicted B-V colour (by 0.05 mag in our models) is in better agreement with both the colours of luminous red galaxies and globular cluster data. We test the models on their ability to reproduce, through full spectral fitting, the ages and metallicities of Galactic globular clusters as derived from colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) fitting and find overall good agreement. We also discuss extensively the Lick indices calculated directly on the integrated MILES-based spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and compare them with element ratio-sensitive index models. We find a good agreement between the two models, if the metallicity-dependent chemical pattern of the Milky Way stars is properly taken into account in this comparison. As a consequence, the ages and metallicities of Galactic globular clusters are not well reproduced when one uses straight the MILES-based indices, because subtle chemical effects on individual lines dominate the age derivation. The best agreement with the ages of the calibrating globular clusters is found with either element ratio-sensitive absorption-line models or the full SED fitting, for which no particular weight is given to selected lines.},

abstract = {In this work, we present galaxy stellar and baryonic (stars plus cold gas) mass functions (SMF and BMF) and their halo mass dependence for two volume-limited data sets. The first, RESOLVE-B, coincides with the Stripe 82 footprint and is extremely complete down to baryonic mass Mbary {\~{}} 10{\^{}}9.1 Msun, probing the gas-rich dwarf regime below Mbary {\~{}} 10{\^{}}10 Msun. The second, ECO, covers a {\~{}}40 times larger volume (containing RESOLVE-A) and is complete to Mbary {\~{}} 10{\^{}}9.4 Msun. To construct the SMF and BMF we implement a new "cross-bin sampling" technique with Monte Carlo sampling from the full likelihood distributions of stellar or baryonic mass. Our SMFs exhibit the "plateau" feature starting below Mstar {\~{}} 10{\^{}}10 Msun that has been described in prior work. However, the BMF fills in this feature and rises as a straight power law below {\~{}}10{\^{}}10 Msun, as gas-dominated galaxies become the majority of the population. Nonetheless, the low-mass slope of the BMF is not as steep as that of the theoretical dark matter halo MF. Moreover, we assign group halo masses by abundance matching, finding that the SMF and BMF separated into four physically motivated halo mass regimes reveal complex structure underlying the simple shape of the overall MFs. In particular, the satellite MFs are depressed below the central galaxy MF "humps" in groups with mass {\textless}10{\^{}}13.5 Msun yet rise steeply in clusters. Our results suggest that satellite destruction and/or stripping are active from the point of nascent group formation. We show that the key role of groups in shaping MFs enables reconstruction of a given survey's SMF or BMF based on its group halo mass distribution.},

abstract = {We present a photometric analysis of four galaxies classified as compact elliptical (cE) galaxies in the FS90 Antlia Group catalogue. Only 6 members of this rare type of galaxies are known until now. Using data in various photometric systems, we measured brightness and colour profiles, as well as structural parameters. By comparing them with those of other galaxies in the Antlia cluster, as well as with confirmed cE galaxies from the literature, we found that two of the FS90 cE candidates, albeit being spectroscopically confirmed Antlia members, are not cE galaxies. However, one of these objects presents strong ellipticity and position angle variations that resemble those already reported for M32, leading us to speculate about this kind of objects being progenitors of cE galaxies. The other two FS90 cE candidates, for which radial velocities are not available, match some features typical of cE galaxies like being close in projection to a larger galaxy, displaying flat colour profiles, and having a high degree of compactness. Only one of the remaining cE candidates shows a high central surface brightness, two components in its brightness profile, distinct changes in ellipticity and position angle where the outer component begins to dominate, and seems to follow the same trend as other confirmed cE galaxies in a luminosity versus mean effective surface brightness diagram. Moreover, it shows a distorted inner structure with similar characteristics to those found by simulations of interacting galaxies, and an extremely faint structure that seems to link this object with one of the Antlia dominant galaxies, has been detected in MOSAIC-CTIO, FORS1-VLT, and ACS-HST images. The cE nature of this galaxy as well as the possible interaction with its bright companion, still have to be confirmed through spectroscopy.},

abstract = {We relate various measures of galaxy mass, using new data for the Nearby Field Galaxy Survey (NFGS). (1) Key mass and velocity transition scales previously identified in the literature are put on a common scale, indicating that the ``bimodality mass'' at M*{\~{}}a few×1010 Msolar corresponds to V{\~{}}190 km s-1 and is distinct from the gas-richness ``threshold mass'' at M*{\~{}}several×109 Msolar, which roughly corresponds to V{\~{}}120 km s-1. This value of the threshold mass is based on ionized gas detections and HI data for the NFGS, a smaller but statistically better-defined sample than that used for the original identification of the gas-richness threshold. (2) We argue that R-band light is the best available photometric tracer of dynamical mass over a wide range in mass and morphology, whereas U and K more closely trace just gas and stellar mass, respectively. The NFGS confirms evidence for an incredibly tight correlation between U-K color and atomic-gas-to-stellar mass ratio Matomic gas/Mstars, yielding rms scatter $\sigma${\~{}}= a factor of 2 (FWHM {\~{}}= a factor of 5) in Matomic gas/Mstars. (3) We examine why U band light from recent star formation correlates so well with atomic gas, when stars form in molecular gas. We propose that time-averaged molecular-to-atomic gas ratios stay within a factor of {\~{}}5 range over the 100+Myr timescales to which the U band is sensitive, due to episodic gas inflow events that replenish molecular gas, and we show evidence for such events. Finally, we consider the implications of these results for the design of the RESOLVE Survey, a mass census of the z = 0 cosmic web.},

This paper describes the survey design, the spectroscopic observations, the redshift measurements and the survey database. The 2dFGRS uses the 2dF multi-fibre spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope, which is capable of observing 400 objects simultaneously over a 2-degree diameter field. The source catalogue for the survey is a revised and extended version of the APM galaxy catalogue, and the targets are galaxies with extinction-corrected magnitudes brighter than b{\_}J=19.45. The main survey regions are two declination strips, one in the southern Galactic hemisphere spanning 80deg x 15deg around the SGP, and the other in the northern Galactic hemisphere spanning 75deg x 10deg along the celestial equator; in addition, there are 99 fields spread over the southern Galactic cap. The survey covers 2000 sq.deg and has a median depth of z=0.11. Adaptive tiling is used to give a highly uniform sampling rate of 93{\%} over the whole survey region. Redshifts are measured from spectra covering 3600A-8000A at a two-pixel resolution of 9.0A and a median S/N of 13 per pixel. All redshift identifications are visually checked and assigned a quality parameter Q in the range 1-5; Q{\textgreater}=3 redshifts are 98.4{\%} reliable and have an rms uncertainty of 85 km/s. The overall redshift completeness for Q{\textgreater}=3 redshifts is 91.8{\%}, but this varies with magnitude from 99{\%} for the brightest galaxies to 90{\%} for objects at the survey limit.

We combine HST imaging for early-type galaxies from the ACS Virgo Cluster Survey with ground-based long-slit spectra from KPNO to show that the masses of compact stellar nuclei in Virgo Cluster galaxies obey a tight correlation with the masses of the host galaxies. The same correlation is obeyed by the supermassive black holes (SBHs) found in predominantly massive galaxies. The compact stellar nuclei in the Local Group galaxies M33 and NGC205 are also found to fall along this same scaling relation. These results indicate that a generic by-product of galaxy formation is the creation of a Central Massive Object (CMO) -- either a SBH or a compact stellar nucleus -- that contains a mean fraction, {\~{}} 0.2{\%}, of the total galactic mass. In galaxies with masses greater than a few times 10{\^{}}10 solar masses, SBHs appear to be the dominant mode of CMO formation.},

abstract = {The stellar kinematics of the low-luminosity elliptical galaxy NGC 4486B have been measured in seeing $\sigma$* = 0.22" with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and Subarcsecond Imaging Spectrograph. Lauer and collaborators have shown that NGC 4486B is similar to M31 in having a double nucleus. Here we show that it also resembles M31 in its kinematics. Like M31, NGC 4486B rotates fairly rapidly near the center (V = 76 +/- 7 km s-1 at 0.6") but more slowly farther out (V {\~{}}= 20 +/- 6 km s-1 at r {\~{}}= 4"). Also, the velocity dispersion gradient is very steep: $\sigma$ increases from 116 +/- 6 km s-1 at r = 2"-6" to $\sigma$ = 281 +/- 11 km s-1 at the center. This is much higher than expected for an elliptical galaxy of absolute magnitude MB {\~{}}= -16.8: even more than M31, NGC 4486B is far above the scatter in the Faber-Jackson correlation between $\sigma$ and bulge luminosity. Therefore, the King core mass-to-light ratio, M/LV {\~{}}= 20, is unusually high compared with normal values for old stellar populations (M/LV = 4 +/- 1 at MB {\~{}}= -17).  We construct simple dynamical models with isotropic velocity dispersions and show that they reproduce black hole (BH) masses derived by more detailed methods. We also fit axisymmetric, three-integral models. Isotropic models imply that NGC 4486B contains a central dark object, probably a BH, of mass M• = 6+3-2 × 108 Msolar. However, anisotropic models fit the data without a BH if the ratio of radial to azimuthal dispersions is {\~{}}2 at r {\~{}}= 1". Therefore, this is a less strong BH detection than the ones in M31, M32, and NGC 3115. A dark mass of 6 × 108 Msolar is {\~{}}9{\%} of the mass Mbulge in stars; even if M• is somewhat smaller than the isotropic value, M•/Mbulge is likely to be unusually large.  Double nuclei are a puzzle because the dynamical friction timescales for self-gravitating star clusters in close orbit around each other are short. Since both M31 and NGC 4486B contain central dark objects, our results support models in which the survival of a double nucleus is connected with the presence of a BH. For example, they support the Keplerian eccentric disk model due to Tremaine.},

abstract = {We have determined the dynamical mass of the most luminous stellar cluster known to date, i.e. object W3 in the merger remnant galaxy NGC 7252. The dynamical mass is estimated from the velocity dispersion measured with the high-resolution spectrograph UVES on VLT. Our result is the astonishingly high velocity dispersion of sigma=45 +- 5 km/s. Combined with the large cluster size R{\_}eff=17.5 +-1.8 pc, this translates into a dynamical virial mass for W3 of 8 +- 2 x 10{\^{}}7 Msun. This mass is in excellent agreement with the value 7.2 x 10{\^{}}7 Msun we previously estimated from the cluster luminosity M{\_}V=-16.2 by means of stellar M/L ratios predicted by Simple Stellar Population models (with a Salpeter IMF) and confirms the heavy-weight nature of this object. This results points out that the NGC 7252-type of mergers are able to form stellar systems with masses up to {\~{}} 10{\^{}}8 Msun. We find that W3, when evolved to {\~{}} 10 Gyr, lies far from the typical Milky Way globular clusters, but appears to be also separated from omegaCen in the Milky Way and G1 in M31, the most massive old stellar clusters of the Local Group, because it is too extended for a given mass, and from dwarf elliptical galaxies because it is much more compact for its mass. Instead the aged W3 is amazingly close to the compact objects named ultracompact dwarf galaxies (UCDGs) found in the Fornax cluster (Hilker et al. 1999; Drinkwater et al. 2000), and to a miniature version of the compact elliptical M32. These objects start populating a previously deserted region of the fundamental plane.},

abstract = {Recent spectroscopic and morphological observational studies of galaxies around NGC 1399 in the Fornax Cluster (Drinkwater et al. 2000b) have discovered several `ultra-compact dwarf' galaxies with intrinsic sizes of {\$}\backslashsim{\$} 100 pc and absolute {\$}B{\$} band magnitudes ranging from -13 to -11 mag. In order to elucidate the origin of these enigmatic objects, we perform numerical simulations on the dynamical evolution of nucleated dwarf galaxies orbiting NGC 1399 and suffering from its strong tidal gravitational field. Adopting a plausible scaling relation for dwarf galaxies, we find that the outer stellar components of a nucleated dwarf are totally removed. This is due to them being tidally stripped over the course of several passages past the central region of NGC 1399. The nucleus, however, manages to survive. We also find that the size and luminosity of the remnant are similar to those observed for ultra-compact dwarf galaxies, if the simulated precursor nucleated dwarf has a mass of {\$}\backslashsim{\$} {\$}10{\^{}}8{\$} {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}. These results suggest that ultra-compact dwarf galaxies could have previously been more luminous dwarf spheroidal or elliptical galaxies with rather compact nuclei.},

abstract = {The shape and wide diversity of dwarf galaxy rotation curves is at apparent odds with dark matter halos in LCDM. We generate mock rotation curve data from dwarf galaxy simulations to show that this owes to bursty star formation driven by stellar feedback. There are three main effects. Firstly, stellar feedback transforms dark matter cusps into cores. Ignoring such transformations leads to a poor fit of the rotation curve shape and a large systematic bias on the halo concentration parameter c. Secondly, if close to a recent starburst, large HI bubbles push the rotation curve out of equilibrium. This makes the gas rotational velocity a poor probe of the underlying potential, leading to a systematic error on the halo virial mass M200 of up to half a dex. Thirdly, when galaxies are viewed near face-on (i{\textless}40deg), it is challenging to properly correct for their inclination i. This leads to a very shallow rotation curve, with a systematic underestimate of M200 of over a dex. All three problems can be easily avoided, however. Using a new coreNFW profile that accounts for cusp-core transformations, we show that we are able to successfully recover the rotation curve shape; dark matter halo mass M200; and concentration parameter c within our quoted uncertainties, provided that the galaxy is close to equilibrium.   We fit our coreNFW model to four dwarf irregulars chosen to span a range of rotation curve shapes. We obtain an excellent fit for NGC 6822 and WLM. However, IC 1613 and DDO 101 give a poor fit. For IC 1613, this owes to disequilibria and its uncertain inclination; for DDO 101, the problem is its uncertain distance. Assuming i{\_}IC1613 {\~{}} 15deg and D{\_}DDO101 {\~{}} 12Mpc, we are able to fit both galaxies very well. We conclude that, once we avoid disequilibrium galaxies, or those with poorly measured inclination and/or distance, LCDM gives a remarkable match to dwarf galaxy rotation curves.},

This comparison considers stellar mass estimates based on (1) two different calibrations of the correlation between K-band mass-to-light ratio and B-R color and (2) detailed fitting of UBRJHK photometry and optical spectrophotometry using two different population synthesis models (Bruzual-Charlot and Maraston), with the same initial mass function in all cases. We also compare stellar+gas masses with dynamical masses. This analysis offers only weak arguments for preferring a particular stellar mass estimation method, given the plausibility of real variations in dynamical properties and dark matter content. These results help to calibrate the systematic uncertainties inherent in mass-based evolutionary studies of galaxies, including comparisons of low- and high-redshift galaxies.},

abstract = {We present a two-dimensional (2-D) fitting algorithm (GALFIT) designed to extract structural components from galaxy images, with emphasis on closely modeling light profiles of spatially well-resolved, nearby galaxies observed with the Hubble Space Telescope. Our algorithm improves on previous techniques in two areas, by being able to simultaneously fit a galaxy with an arbitrary number of components, and with optimization in computation speed, suited for working on large galaxy images. We use 2-D models such as the ``Nuker'' law, the Sersic (de Vaucouleurs) profile, an exponential disk, and Gaussian or Moffat functions. The azimuthal shapes are generalized ellipses that can fit disky and boxy components. Many galaxies with complex isophotes, ellipticity changes, and position-angle twists can be modeled accurately in 2-D. When examined in detail, we find that even simple-looking galaxies generally require at least three components to be modeled accurately, rather than the one or two components more often employed. We illustrate this by way of 7 case studies, which include regular and barred spiral galaxies, highly disky lenticular galaxies, and elliptical galaxies displaying various levels of complexities. A useful extension of this algorithm is to accurately extract nuclear point sources in galaxies. We compare 2-D and 1-D extraction techniques on simulated images of galaxies having nuclear slopes with different degrees of cuspiness, and we then illustrate the application of the program to several examples of nearby galaxies with weak nuclei.},

abstract = {We report the discovery of an Ultra Compact Dwarf (UCD) associated with the Sombrero galaxy (M104). This is the closest massive UCD known and the first spectroscopically verified massive UCD which is located in a low density environment.   The object, we name SUCD1, was identified in HST/ACS imaging and confirmed to be associated with the Sombrero galaxy by its recession velocity obtained from Keck spectra. The light profile is well fitted by a Wilson model. We measure a half light size of 14.7 +/- 1.4 pc, an absolute magnitude of M{\_}V = -12.3 mag (M{\_}K = -15.1 mag) and an internal velocity dispersion of 25.0 +/- 5.6 km/s. Such values are typical of UCDs. From Lick spectral indices we measure a luminosity-weighted central age of 12.6 +/- 0.9 Gyrs, [Fe/H] of -0.08 +/- 0.08 dex and [alpha/Fe] of 0.06 +/- 0.07 dex. The lack of colour gradients suggests these values are representative of the entire UCD. The derived stellar and virial masses are the same, within errors, at {\~{}}3.3 x 10E7 Msun. Thus we find no strong evidence for dark matter or the need to invoke a non-standard IMF.   We also report arguably the first X-ray detection of a bona fide UCD, which we attribute to the presence of Low-Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs). The X-ray luminosity of L{\_}X = 0.56 x 10E38 erg/s is consistent with the values observed for GCs of the same metallicity. Overall we find SUCD1 has properties similar to other known UCDs and massive GCs.},

abstract = {Galaxy morphologies in clusters have undergone a remarkable transition over the past several billion years. Distant clusters at {\$}z \backslashsim 0.4{\$} are filled with small spiral galaxies, many of which are disturbed and show evidence of multiple bursts of star-formation. This population is absent from nearby clusters where spheroidals comprise the faint end of the luminosity function. Our numerical simulations follow the evolution of disk galaxies in a rich cluster owing to encounters with brighter galaxies and the cluster's tidal field---galaxy harassment. After a bursting transient phase, they undergo a complete morphological transformation from "disks" to"spheroidals". We examine the remnants and find support for our theory in detailed comparisons of the photometry and kinematics of the spheroidal galaxies in clusters. Our model naturally accounts for the intermediate age stellar population seen in these spheroidals as well as the trend in dwarf to giant ratio with cluster richness. The final shapes are typically prolate and are flattened primarily by velocity anisotropy. Their mass to light ratios are in the range 3---8 in good agreement with observations.},

abstract = {How did the dwarf galaxy population of present-day galaxy clusters form and grow over time? We address this question by analysing the history of dark matter subhaloes in the Millennium-II cosmological simulation. A semi-analytic model serves as the link to observations. We argue that a reasonable analogue to early morphological types or red-sequence dwarf galaxies are those subhaloes that experienced strong mass loss, or alternatively those that have spent a long time in massive haloes. This approach reproduces well the observed morphology-distance relation of dwarf galaxies in the Virgo and Coma clusters, and thus provides insight into their history. Over their lifetime, present-day late types have experienced an amount of environmental influence similar to what the progenitors of dwarf ellipticals had already experienced at redshifts above two. Therefore, dwarf ellipticals are more likely to be a result of early and continuous environmental influence in group- and cluster-size haloes, rather than a recent transformation product. The observed morphological sequences of late-type and early-type galaxies have developed in parallel, not consecutively. Consequently, the characteristics of today's late-type galaxies are not necessarily representative for the progenitors of today's dwarf ellipticals. Studies aiming to reproduce the present-day dwarf population thus need to start at early epochs, model the influence of various environments, and also take into account the evolution of the environments themselves.},

The spectra were taken at the Keck telescope using the HIRES spectrograph with a resolution of 8 km s-1 (FWHM). Emission-line profiles are roughly Gaussian with velocity widths sigma {\~{}} 30 to 50 km s-1. The new sigma data, in combination with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) measurements of half-light radii Re, indicate that these CNELGs are low-mass stellar systems (i.e., M {\~{}} 109 M⊙), while their unusually low mass-to-light ratios (typically {\textless}0.2 M⊙/L⊙) are consistent with being undergoing a major burst of star formation. Since Re and sigma are roughly independent of the fading of the stellar population, the Re-- sigma diagram is particularly useful for comparing the properties of these young galaxies to those of evolved stellar systems. Several physical processes that may modify the position of CNELGs in this diagram during their evolution, including dissipation, mergers, stripping, and winds, are discussed briefly. We conclude that the new data support a simple evolutionary scenario in which these low-mass, young galaxies will fade after the starburst, without major changes in Re or sigma , to become today's spheroidal galaxies.},

Our technique results in no size-dependent bias in galaxy fluxes up to half-light radii of 100 arcsec; in contrast, for galaxies of that size the standard SDSS photometric catalog underestimates fluxes by about 1.5 mag.

These objects are all within 30 arcminutes of the central galaxy of the cluster, NGC 1399, but are distributed over larger radii than the globular cluster system of that galaxy. We suggest that these objects are either super-massive star clusters (intra-cluster globular clusters or tidally stripped nuclei of dwarf galaxies) or a new type of low-luminosity compact elliptical dwarf (M32-type) galaxy. The best way to test these hypotheses will be to obtain high resolution imaging and high-dispersion spectroscopy to determine their structures and mass-to-light ratios. This will allow us to compare them to known compact objects and establish if they represent a new class of hitherto unknown stellar system.},

abstract = {We use imaging from the Next Generation Virgo cluster Survey (NGVS) to present a comparative study of ultra-compact dwarf (UCD) galaxies associated with three prominent Virgo sub-clusters: those centered on the massive, red-sequence galaxies M87, M49 and M60. We show how UCDs can be selected with high completeness using a combination of half-light radius and location in color-color diagrams ({\$}u{\^{}}*iK{\_}s{\$} or {\$}u{\^{}}*gz{\$}). Although the central galaxies in each of these sub-clusters have nearly identical luminosities and stellar masses, we find large differences in the sizes of their UCD populations, with M87 containing {\~{}}3.5 and 7.8 times more UCDs than M49 and M60, respectively. The relative abundance of UCDs in the three regions scales in proportion to sub-cluster mass, as traced by X-ray gas mass, total gravitating mass, number of globular clusters, and number of nearby galaxies. We find that the UCDs are predominantly blue in color, with {\~{}}85{\%} of the UCDs having colors similar to blue GCs and stellar nuclei of dwarf galaxies. We present evidence that UCDs surrounding M87 and M49 may follow a morphological sequence ordered by the prominence of their outer, low surface brightness envelope, ultimately merging with the sequence of nucleated low-mass galaxies, and that envelope prominence correlates with distance from either galaxy. Our analysis provides evidence that tidal stripping of nucleated galaxies is an important process in the formation of UCDs.},

abstract = {The previously clear division between small galaxies and massive star clusters is now occupied by objects called ultra compact dwarfs (UCDs) and compact ellipticals (cEs). Here we combine a sample of UCDs and cEs with velocity dispersions from the AIMSS project with literature data to explore their dynamical-to-stellar mass ratios.   We confirm that the mass ratios of many UCDs in the stellar mass range 10{\$}{\^{}}6{\$} -- 10{\$}{\^{}}9{\$} M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} are systematically higher than those for globular clusters which have mass ratios near unity. However, at the very highest masses in our sample, i.e. 10{\$}{\^{}}9{\$} -- 10{\$}{\^{}}{\{}10{\}}{\$} M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}, we find that cE galaxies also have mass ratios of close to unity, indicating their central regions are mostly composed of stars.   Suggested explanations for the elevated mass ratios of UCDs have included a variable IMF, a central black hole, and the presence of dark matter. Here we present another possible explanation, i.e. tidal stripping. Under various assumptions, we find that the apparent variation in the mass ratio with stellar mass and stellar density can be qualitatively reproduced by published tidal stripping simulations of a dwarf elliptical galaxy. In the early stages of the stripping process the galaxy is unlikely to be in virial equilibrium. At late stages, the final remnant resembles the properties of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}10{\$}{\^{}}7{\$} M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} UCDs. Finally, we discuss the need for more detailed realistic modelling of tidal stripping over a wider range of parameter space, and observations to further test the stripping hypothesis.},

For Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies, we measure the group environment, meaning the host group luminosity and the distance from the group center (hereafter ``groupocentric distance''). For comparison, we measure the surrounding density field on scales ranging from 100 h-1 kpc to 10 h-1 Mpc. We use the relationship between color and group environment to test the null hypothesis that only the group environment matters, searching for a residual dependence of properties on the surrounding density. Generally, red galaxies are slightly more clustered on small scales ({\~{}}100-300 h-1 kpc) than the null hypothesis predicts, possibly indicating that substructure within groups has some importance. At large scales ({\textgreater}1 h-1 Mpc), the actual projected correlation functions of galaxies are biased at less than the 5{\%} level with respect to the null hypothesis predictions. We exclude strongly the converse null hypothesis: that only the surrounding density (on any scale) matters. These results generally encourage the use of the halo model description of galaxy bias, which models the galaxy distribution as a function of host halo mass alone. We compare these results to proposed galaxy formation scenarios within the cold dark matter cosmological model.},

@article{Vollmer2009,
abstract = {Based on a comparison of dynamical models with observations of the interstellar gas in 6 Virgo cluster spiral galaxies a first complete ram pressure stripping time sequence has been established. The observational characteristics of the different stages of ram pressure stripping are presented. The dynamical models yield the 3D velocity vectors of the galaxies, peak ram pressures, and times to peak ram pressure. In the case of a smooth, static, and spherical intracluster medium, peak ram pressure occurs during the galaxy's closest approach to the cluster center, i.e. when the galaxy's velocity vector is perpendicular to its distance vector from the cluster center (M 87). Assuming this condition the galaxy's present line-of-sight distance and its 3D position during peak ram pressure can be calculated. The linear orbital segments derived in this way together with the intracluster medium density distribution derived from X-ray observations give estimates of the ram pressure that are on average a factor of 2 higher than derived from the dynamical simulations for NGC 4501, NGC 4330, and NGC 4569. Resolving this discrepancy would require either a 2 times higher intracluster medium density than derived from X-ray observations, or a 2 times higher stripping efficiency than assumed by the dynamical models. Compared to NGC 4501, NGC 4330, and NGC 4569, NGC 4388 requires a still 2 times higher local intracluster medium density or a direction which is moderately different from that derived from the dynamical model. A possible scenario for the dynamical evolution of NGC 4438 and M 86 within the Virgo cluster is presented.},

The Galactic tidal force can induce radial inflow of gas to the dwarf's center and consequently triggers moderately strong nuclear starbursts in a repetitive manner. This result implies that efficient nuclear chemical enrichment resulting from the later starbursts can be closely associated with the origin of the observed relatively young and metal-rich stars in {\$}\backslashomega{\$} Cen. Dynamical heating by the {\$}\backslashomega{\$} Cen's host can transform the young thin disc into the thick disc during merging.},

All five have absorption-line spectra. With intrinsic sizes of less than 1.1" HWHM (corresponding to approximately 100 pc at the distance of the cluster), they are more compact and significantly less luminous than other known compact dwarf galaxies, yet much brighter than any globular cluster. In this paper we present new ground-based optical observations of these enigmatic objects. In addition to having extremely high central surface brightnesses, these objects show no evidence of any surrounding low surface brightness envelopes down to much fainter limits than is the case for, e.g., nucleated dwarf elliptical galaxies. Thus, if they are not merely the stripped remains of some other type of galaxy, then they appear to have properties unlike any previously known type of stellar system.},

The properties of these objects remain consistent with the tidal threshing model for the origin of UCDs from the surviving nuclei of nucleated dwarf elliptical galaxies disrupted in the cluster core but can also be explained as objects that were formed by mergers of star clusters created in galaxy interactions. The discovery that UCDs exist in Virgo shows that this galaxy type is probably a ubiquitous phenomenon in clusters of galaxies; coupled with their possible origin by tidal threshing, the UCD population is a potential indicator and probe of the formation history of a given cluster. We also describe one additional bright UCD with MB=-12.0 in the core of the Fornax Cluster. We find no further UCDs in our Fornax Cluster Spectroscopic Survey down to bj=19.5 in two additional 2dF fields extending as far as 3° from the center of the cluster.

abstract = {We investigate the connection between globular clusters and ultracompact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) by examining the properties of 10 compact, high-luminosity (-11.8  MV  -10.8) objects associated with M87 (NGC 4486, VCC 1316), the cD galaxy in the Virgo Cluster. These objects, most of which were previously classified as M87 globular clusters, were selected from a combination of ground- and space-based imaging surveys. Our observational database for these objects - which we term DGTOs, or "dwarf-globular transition objects" - includes Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) F475W and F850LP imaging from the ACS Virgo Cluster Survey, integrated-light spectroscopy from Keck/ESI, and archival F606W WFPC2 imaging. We also present a search for DGTOs associated with other galaxies based on ACS imaging for 100 early-type galaxies in Virgo. Our main findings can be summarized as follows:  1. Of the six DGTOs in M87 with both ground-based spectroscopy and HST imaging, we find two objects to have half-light radii, velocity dispersions, and mass-to-light ratios that are consistent with the predictions of population synthesis models for old, metal-rich, high-luminosity globular clusters.  2. Three other DGTOs are much larger, with half-light radii rh {\~{}} 20 pc, and have V-band mass-to-light ratios in the range 6  M/LV  9. These objects, which we consider to be UCDs, resemble the nuclei of nucleated dwarf elliptical galaxies in the Virgo Cluster, having similar mass-to-light ratios, luminosities, and colors.  3. The classification of the sixth object is more uncertain, but it bears a strong resemblance to simulated "stellar superclusters," which are presumed to form through the amalgamation of multiple young massive clusters.  4. In general, the UCDs in M87 are found to follow the extrapolated scaling relations of galaxies more closely than those of globular clusters. There appears to be a transition between the two types of stellar systems at a mass of  2 × 10{\^{}}6 M. We suggest that the presence of dark matter is the fundamental property distinguishing globular clusters from UCDs.  5. We identify a sample of 13 DGTO candidates from the complete ACS Virgo Cluster Survey, selecting on the basis of half-light radius, magnitude, and color. For a number of these objects, membership in Virgo can be established through radial velocities or surface brightness fluctuation measurements with our ACS images. Three of these DGTO candidates are embedded in low-surface brightness envelopes.  6. Five of the 13 DGTOs in Virgo are associated with a single galaxy: M87. This finding suggests that proximity to the Virgo center may be of critical importance for the formation of these objects, although we find M87 to be more abundant in DGTOs than would be expected on the basis of its luminosity, the size of its globular cluster system, or the local galaxy density.  These results show that distinguishing bona fide UCDs from high-luminosity globular clusters requires a careful analysis of their detailed structural and dynamical properties, particularly their mass-to-light ratios. In general, the properties of the UCDs in our sample are consistent with models in which these objects form through tidal stripping of nucleated dwarf galaxies.

abstract = {The Goodman Spectrograph is an imaging, multi-object spectrograph for the SOuthern Astrophysical Research telescope (SOAR). It is one of the first designed to take advantage of Volume Phase Holographic (VPH) gratings by employing an articulated camera. This aspect of the mechanical design has had complicating effects on a number of usually simple systems, and has led to some unorthodox solutions. The spectrograph is also highly optimized for efficiency from 320 to 850 nm, and designed for rapid configuration changes, so that its throughput makes it competitive with instruments on larger telescopes. We present the high level requirements that have driven the mechanical and electronic systems, and show their implementation in the completed instrument. It is too early to assess the overall system performance, but tests of the modular subsystems show promising results. We discuss the expected overall performance and discuss mitigation strategies should that performance fall short of our goals.},

abstract = {We compare the predictions of a semi-analytic model for ultra-compact dwarf galaxy (UCD) formation by tidal stripping to the observed properties of globular clusters (GCs) and UCDs in the Fornax and Virgo clusters. For Fornax we find the predicted number of stripped nuclei agrees very well with the excess number of GCs{\$}+{\$}UCDs above the GC luminosity function. GCs{\$}+{\$}UCDs with masses {\$}{\textgreater}10{\^{}}{\{}7.3{\}}{\$} M{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$} are consistent with being entirely formed by tidal stripping. Stripped nuclei can also account for Virgo UCDs with masses {\$}{\textgreater}10{\^{}}{\{}7.3{\}}{\$} M{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$} where numbers are complete by mass. For both Fornax and Virgo, the predicted velocity dispersions and radial distributions of stripped nuclei are consistent with that of UCDs within {\$}\backslashsim{\$}50-100 kpc but disagree at larger distances where dispersions are too high and radial distributions too extended. Stripped nuclei are predicted to have radially biased anisotropies at all radii, agreeing with Virgo UCDs at clustercentric distances larger than 50 kpc. However, ongoing disruption is not included in our model which would cause orbits to become tangentially biased at small radii. We find the predicted metallicities and central black hole masses of stripped nuclei agree well with the metallicities and implied black hole masses of UCDs for masses {\$}{\textgreater}10{\^{}}{\{}6.5{\}}{\$} M{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$}. The predicted black hole masses also agree well with that of M60-UCD1, the first UCD with a confirmed central black hole. These results suggest that observed GC{\$}+{\$}UCD populations are a combination of genuine GCs and stripped nuclei, with the contribution of stripped nuclei increasing toward the high-mass end.},

abstract = {The discovery of the gravitational-wave source GW150914 with the Advanced LIGO detectors provides the first observational evidence for the existence of binary black-hole systems that inspiral and merge within the age of the Universe. Such black-hole mergers have been predicted in two main types of formation models, involving isolated binaries in galactic fields or dynamical interactions in young and old dense stellar environments. The measured masses robustly demonstrate that relatively "heavy" black holes ({\$}\backslashgtrsim 25\backslash, M{\_}\backslashodot{\$}) can form in nature. This discovery implies relatively weak massive-star winds and thus the formation of GW150914 in an environment with metallicity lower than {\$}\backslashsim 1/2{\$} of the solar value. The rate of binary black-hole mergers inferred from the observation of GW150914 is consistent with the higher end of rate predictions ({\$}\backslashgtrsim 1 \backslash, \backslashmathrm{\{}Gpc{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}} \backslash, \backslashmathrm{\{}yr{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}) from both types of formation models. The low measured redshift ({\$}z \backslashsim 0.1{\$}) of GW150914 and the low inferred metallicity of the stellar progenitor imply either binary black-hole formation in a low-mass galaxy in the local Universe and a prompt merger, or formation at high redshift with a time delay between formation and merger of several Gyr. This discovery motivates further studies of binary-black-hole formation astrophysics. It also has implications for future detections and studies by Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo, and gravitational-wave detectors in space.},

abstract = {Motivated by the recent, serendipitous discovery of the densest known galaxy, M60-UCD1, we present two initial findings from a follow-up search, using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Subaru/Suprime-Cam and Hubble Space Telescope imaging, and SOuthern Astrophysical Research (SOAR)/Goodman spectroscopy. The first object discovered, M59-UCD3, has a similar size to M60-UCD1 (half-light radius of r{\_}h {\~{}} 20 pc) but is 40{\%} more luminous (M{\_}V {\~{}} -14.6), making it the new densest-known galaxy. The second, M85-HCC1, has a size like a typical globular cluster (GC; r{\_}h {\~{}} 1.8 pc) but is much more luminous (M{\_}V {\~{}} -12.5). This hypercompact cluster is by far the densest confirmed free-floating stellar system, and is equivalent to the densest known nuclear star clusters. From spectroscopy, we find that both objects are relatively young ({\~{}}9 Gyr and {\~{}}3 Gyr, respectively), with metal-abundances that resemble those of galaxy centers. Their host galaxies show clear signs of large-scale disturbances, and we conclude that these dense objects are the remnant nuclei of recently accreted galaxies. M59-UCD3 is an ideal target for follow-up with high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy to search for an overweight central supermassive black hole as was discovered in M60-UCD1. These findings also emphasize the potential value of ultra-compact dwarfs and massive GCs as tracers of the assembly histories of galaxies.},

abstract = {We present measurements of the galaxy luminosity and stellar mass function in a 3.71 deg{\$}{\^{}}2{\$} (0.3 Mpc{\$}{\^{}}2{\$}) area in the core of the Virgo cluster, based on {\$}ugriz{\$} data from the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS). The galaxy sample consists of 352 objects brighter than {\$}M{\_}g=-9.13{\$} mag, the 50{\%} completeness limit of the survey. Using a Bayesian analysis, we find a best-fit faint end slope of {\$}\backslashalpha=-1.33 \backslashpm 0.02{\$} for the g-band luminosity function; consistent results are found for the stellar mass function as well as the luminosity function in the other four NGVS bandpasses. We discuss the implications for the faint-end slope of adding 92 ultra compact dwarfs galaxies (UCDs) -- previously compiled by the NGVS in this region -- to the galaxy sample, assuming that UCDs are the stripped remnants of nucleated dwarf galaxies. Under this assumption, the slope of the luminosity function (down to the UCD faint magnitude limit, {\$}M{\_}g = -9.6{\$} mag) increases dramatically, up to {\$}\backslashalpha = -1.60 \backslashpm 0.06{\$} when correcting for the expected number of disrupted non-nucleated galaxies. We also calculate the total number of UCDs and globular clusters that may have been deposited in the core of Virgo due to the disruption of satellites, both nucleated and non-nucleated. We estimate that {\~{}}150 objects with {\$}M{\_}g\backslashlesssim-9.6{\$} mag and that are currently classified as globular clusters, might, in fact, be the nuclei of disrupted galaxies. We further estimate that as many as 40{\%} of the (mostly blue) globular clusters in the core of Virgo might once have belonged to such satellites; these same disrupted satellites might have contributed {\~{}}40{\%} of the total luminosity in galaxies observed in the core region today. Finally, we use an updated Local Group galaxy catalog to provide a new measurement of the luminosity function of Local Group satellites, {\$}\backslashalpha=-1.21\backslashpm0.05{\$}.},

abstract = {We update van den Bergh's parallel-sequence galaxy classification in which S0 galaxies form a sequence S0a-S0b-S0c that parallels the sequence Sa-Sb-Sc of spiral galaxies. The ratio B/T of bulge-to-total light defines the position of a galaxy in this tuning-fork diagram. Our classification makes one major improvement. We extend the S0a-S0b-S0c sequence to spheroidal ("Sph") galaxies that are positioned in parallel to irregular galaxies in a similarly extended Sa-Sb-Sc-Im sequence. This provides a natural "home" for spheroidals, which previously were omitted from galaxy classification schemes or inappropriately combined with ellipticals. To motivate our juxtaposition of Sph and Im galaxies, we present photometry and bulge-disk decompositions of four rare, late-type S0s that bridge the gap between the more common S0b and Sph galaxies. NGC 4762 is an edge-on SB0bc galaxy with a very small classical-bulge-to-total ratio of B/T = 0.13 ± 0.02. NGC 4452 is an edge-on SB0 galaxy with an even tinier pseudobulge-to-total ratio of PB/T = 0.017 ± 0.004. It is therefore an SB0c. VCC 2048, whose published classification is S0, contains an edge-on disk, but its "bulge" plots in the structural parameter sequence of spheroidals. It is therefore a disky Sph. And NGC 4638 is similarly a "missing link" between S0s and Sphs—it has a tiny bulge and an edge-on disk embedded in an Sph halo. In the Appendix, we present photometry and bulge-disk decompositions of all Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys Virgo Cluster Survey S0s that do not have published decompositions. We use these data to update the structural parameter correlations of Sph, S+Im, and E galaxies. We show that Sph galaxies of increasing luminosity form a continuous sequence with the disks (but not bulges) of S0c-S0b-S0a galaxies. Remarkably, the Sph-S0-disk sequence is almost identical to that of Im galaxies and spiral galaxy disks. We review published observations for galaxy transformation processes, particularly ram-pressure stripping of cold gas. We suggest that Sph galaxies are transformed, "red and dead" Scd-Im galaxies in the same way that many S0 galaxies are transformed, red and dead Sa-Sc spiral galaxies.},

abstract = {Velocity dispersions for 25 E and S0 galaxies are presented which were measured by employing conventional and Fourier techniques to reduce spectral data obtained in scans of the nuclear regions with an image-dissector scanner. The estimates are based primarily on certain sensitive blends near the Mg b triplet and also on the width of the Na D line. Nuclear values of the mass-to-light ratio (M/L(B)) are calculated using measured values of core radii and central surface brightnesses for several of the sampled galaxies, and it is found that the mean value of M/L(B) for giant ellipticals with an absolute bolometric magnitude of less than -20 is 7(H/50) in solar units. This value agrees well with the values for early-type spirals, implies that there is no large discontinuity in M/L between early-type spirals and ellipticals, and constitutes evidence against a stellar population strongly enriched in M-dwarfs. Both velocity dispersion and M/L(B) are found to be correlated with absolute magnitude for normal ellipticals, and the observed increase in M/L(B) is shown to be consistent with an increase in metal abundance with luminosity. It is concluded that ellipticals are close to being a one-parameter family with total mass as the most important independent variable.},

abstract = {We investigate the interaction history of the M31 sub-group of galaxies by comparing surface photometry of its two nearest satellites, M32 and NGC 205, with N-body simulations of satellite destruction. The recent discovery of a giant stream in M31's outer halo, apparently pointed towards M32 and NGC 205, makes such an investigation particularly relevant. The observational component of this study is based on 1.7 x 5.0 degree B- and I- band CCD mosaic images centered on M31 and covering both satellites. The simulation component of this project is based on the analysis of single-component, spherical model satellites that are tidally disrupted through interactions with their parent galaxy. Generic features of the simulations include an excess in the surface brightness profile at large radii, a depletion zone at intermediate radii, and isophotal elongation and twists that are coincident with breaks in the brightness profile. The satellites M32 and NGC 205 display most of these features consistently across the B and I bands, strongly suggestive of tidal interaction and probable stripping by M31. We discuss what these observed features can tell us about the satellites' orbital parameters and histories. Specifically, M32 is found to be on a highly eccentric orbit and away from pericenter. Investigating M32's unusual combination of high surface brightness and low luminosity (the hallmark of compact ellipticals), we conclude on empirical grounds that M32 is not likely to be the residual core of a tidally-stripped normal elliptical galaxy as has been suggested, but rather that its precursor was intrinsically compact.},
