abstract = {(Abridge) We present a new analysis of the early-type galaxy population in the central region of the Antlia cluster, focusing on the faint systems like dwarf ellipticals (dE) and dwarf spheroidals (dSph). We confirm 22 early-type galaxies as Antlia members, using GEMINI-GMOS and MAGELLAN-MIKE spectra. Among them, 2 belong to the rare type of compact ellipticals (cE), and 5 are new faint dwarfs that had never been catalogued before. In addition, we present 16 newly identified low surface brightness galaxy candidates, almost half of them displaying morphologies consistent with being Antlia's counterparts of Local Group dSphs, that extend the faint luminosity limit of our study down to MB = -10.1 (BT = 22.6) mag. We built an improved CMR in the Washington photometric system, i.e. integrated T1 magnitudes versus (C - T1) colours, which extends $\backslash$sim 4 mag faintwards the limit of spectroscopically confirmed Antlia members. When only confirmed early-type members are considered, this relation extends over 10 mag in luminosity with no apparent change in slope or increase in colour dispersion towards its faint end. The intrinsic colour scatter of the relation is compared with those reported for other clusters of galaxies; we argue that it is likely that the large scatter of the CMR, usually reported at faint magnitudes, is mostly due to photometric errors along with an improper membership/morphological classification. The distinct behaviour of the luminosity versus mean effective surface brightness relation at the bright and faint ends is analyzed, while it is confirmed that dE galaxies on the same relation present a very similar effective radius, regardless of their colour. The projected spatial distribution of the member sample confirms the existence of two groups in Antlia, each one dominated by a giant elliptical galaxy and with one cE located close to each giant.},

abstract = {We present a photometric analysis of four galaxies classified as compact elliptical (cE) galaxies in the FS90 Antlia Group catalogue. Only 6 members of this rare type of galaxies are known until now. Using data in various photometric systems, we measured brightness and colour profiles, as well as structural parameters. By comparing them with those of other galaxies in the Antlia cluster, as well as with confirmed cE galaxies from the literature, we found that two of the FS90 cE candidates, albeit being spectroscopically confirmed Antlia members, are not cE galaxies. However, one of these objects presents strong ellipticity and position angle variations that resemble those already reported for M32, leading us to speculate about this kind of objects being progenitors of cE galaxies. The other two FS90 cE candidates, for which radial velocities are not available, match some features typical of cE galaxies like being close in projection to a larger galaxy, displaying flat colour profiles, and having a high degree of compactness. Only one of the remaining cE candidates shows a high central surface brightness, two components in its brightness profile, distinct changes in ellipticity and position angle where the outer component begins to dominate, and seems to follow the same trend as other confirmed cE galaxies in a luminosity versus mean effective surface brightness diagram. Moreover, it shows a distorted inner structure with similar characteristics to those found by simulations of interacting galaxies, and an extremely faint structure that seems to link this object with one of the Antlia dominant galaxies, has been detected in MOSAIC-CTIO, FORS1-VLT, and ACS-HST images. The cE nature of this galaxy as well as the possible interaction with its bright companion, still have to be confirmed through spectroscopy.},

abstract = {We recently initiated a search for ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) in the Centaurus galaxy cluster (Mieske et al. 2007), resulting in the discovery of 27 compact objects with -12.2<M{\_}V<-10.9 mag. Our overall survey completeness was 15-20{\%} within 120 kpc projected clustercentric distance. In order to better constrain the luminosity distribution of the brightest UCDs in Centaurus, we continue our search by substantially improving our survey completeness specifically in the regime M{\_}V<-12 mag (V{\_}0<21.3 mag). Using VIMOS at the VLT, we obtain low-resolution spectra of 400 compact objects with 19.3<V{\_}0<21.3 mag (-14<M{\_}V<-12 mag at the Centaurus distance) in the central 25' of the Centaurus cluster, which corresponds to a projected radius of {\~{}}150 kpc. Our survey yields complete area coverage within {\~{}}120 kpc. For 94{\%} of the sources included in the masks we successfully measure a redshift. Due to incompleteness in the slit assignment, our final completeness in the area surveyed is 52{\%}. Among our targets we find three new UCDs in the magnitude range -12.2<M{\_}V<-12 mag, hence at the faint limit of our survey. One of them is covered by archival HST WFPC2 imaging, yielding a size estimate of r{\_}h <= 8-9 pc. At 95{\%} confidence we can reject the hypothesis that in the area surveyed there are more than 2 massive UCDs with M{\_}V<-12.2 mag and r{\_}eff <=70 pc. Our survey hence confirms the extreme rareness of massive UCDs. We find that the radial distributions of Centaurus and Fornax UCDs with respect to their host clusters' centers agree within the 2 sigma level.},

abstract = {We present the new catalog of principal galaxies (PGC2003). It constitutes the framework of the HYPERLEDA database that supersedes the LEDA one, with more data and more capabilities. The catalog is still restricted to confirmed galaxies, i.e. about one million galaxies, brighter than {\~{}}18 B-mag.  In order to provide the best possible identification for each galaxy we give: accurate coordinates (typical accuracy better than 2 arcsec), diameter, axis ratio and position angle. Diameters and axis ratios have been homogenized to the RC2 system at the limiting surface brightness of 25 B-mag arcsec-2, using a new method, the EPIDEMIC method.  In order to provide the best designation for each galaxy, we collected the names from 50 catalogues. The compatibility of the spelling is tested against NED and SIMBAD, and, as far as possible we used a spelling compatible with both. For some cases, where no consensus exists between NED, SIMBAD and LEDA, we propose some changes that could make the spelling of names fully compatible.  The full catalog is distributed through the CDS and can be extracted from HYPERLEDA.  Full Tables 1 and 2 are available in electronic form at http://www.edpsciences.org  Full Table 5 is available in electronic form at CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/qcat?/A+A/412/45},

abstract = {We present a two-dimensional (2-D) fitting algorithm (GALFIT) designed to extract structural components from galaxy images, with emphasis on closely modeling light profiles of spatially well-resolved, nearby galaxies observed with the Hubble Space Telescope. Our algorithm improves on previous techniques in two areas, by being able to simultaneously fit a galaxy with an arbitrary number of components, and with optimization in computation speed, suited for working on large galaxy images. We use 2-D models such as the ``Nuker'' law, the Sersic (de Vaucouleurs) profile, an exponential disk, and Gaussian or Moffat functions. The azimuthal shapes are generalized ellipses that can fit disky and boxy components. Many galaxies with complex isophotes, ellipticity changes, and position-angle twists can be modeled accurately in 2-D. When examined in detail, we find that even simple-looking galaxies generally require at least three components to be modeled accurately, rather than the one or two components more often employed. We illustrate this by way of 7 case studies, which include regular and barred spiral galaxies, highly disky lenticular galaxies, and elliptical galaxies displaying various levels of complexities. A useful extension of this algorithm is to accurately extract nuclear point sources in galaxies. We compare 2-D and 1-D extraction techniques on simulated images of galaxies having nuclear slopes with different degrees of cuspiness, and we then illustrate the application of the program to several examples of nearby galaxies with weak nuclei.},

Covering 40{\%} of the final survey area, the alpha.40 catalog contains 15855 sources in the regions 07h30m < R.A. < 16h30m, +04 deg < Dec. < +16 deg and +24 deg < Dec. < +28 deg and 22h < R.A. < 03h, +14 deg < Dec. < +16 deg and +24 deg < Dec. < +32 deg. Of those, 15041 are certainly extragalactic, yielding a source density of 5.3 galaxies per square degree, a factor of 29 improvement over the catalog extracted from the HI Parkes All Sky Survey. In addition to the source centroid positions, HI line flux densities, recessional velocities and line widths, the catalog includes the coordinates of the most probable optical counterpart of each HI line detection, and a separate compilation provides a crossmatch to identifications given in the photometric and spectroscopic catalogs associated with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7. Fewer than 2{\%} of the extragalactic HI line sources cannot be identified with a feasible optical counterpart; some of those may be rare OH megamasers at 0.16 < z < 0.25. A detailed analysis is presented of the completeness, width dependent sensitivity function and bias inherent in the current alpha.40 catalog. The impact of survey selection, distance errors, current volume coverage and local large scale structure on the derivation of the HI mass function is assessed. While alpha.40 does not yet provide a completely representative sampling of cosmological volume, derivations of the HI mass function using future data releases from ALFALFA will further improve both statistical and systematic uncertainties.},

The target catalogue constitutes three contiguous equatorial regions centred at 9h (G09), 12h (G12) and 14.5h (G15) each of 12 x 4 sq.deg to limiting fluxes of r < 19.4, r < 19.8, and r < 19.4 mag respectively (and additional limits at other wavelengths).

abstract = {The 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) is designed to measure redshifts for approximately 250000 galaxies. This paper describes the survey design, the spectroscopic observations, the redshift measurements and the survey database. The 2dFGRS uses the 2dF multi-fibre spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope, which is capable of observing 400 objects simultaneously over a 2-degree diameter field. The source catalogue for the survey is a revised and extended version of the APM galaxy catalogue, and the targets are galaxies with extinction-corrected magnitudes brighter than b{\_}J=19.45. The main survey regions are two declination strips, one in the southern Galactic hemisphere spanning 80deg x 15deg around the SGP, and the other in the northern Galactic hemisphere spanning 75deg x 10deg along the celestial equator; in addition, there are 99 fields spread over the southern Galactic cap. The survey covers 2000 sq.deg and has a median depth of z=0.11. Adaptive tiling is used to give a highly uniform sampling rate of 93{\%} over the whole survey region. Redshifts are measured from spectra covering 3600A-8000A at a two-pixel resolution of 9.0A and a median S/N of 13 per pixel. All redshift identifications are visually checked and assigned a quality parameter Q in the range 1-5; Q>=3 redshifts are 98.4{\%} reliable and have an rms uncertainty of 85 km/s. The overall redshift completeness for Q>=3 redshifts is 91.8{\%}, but this varies with magnitude from 99{\%} for the brightest galaxies to 90{\%} for objects at the survey limit.

abstract = {The Zwicky Catalog of galaxies (ZC), with m{\_}Zw<=15.5mag, has been the basis for the Center for Astrophysics (CfA) redshift surveys. To date, analyses of the ZC and redshift surveys based on it have relied on heterogeneous sets of galaxy coordinates and redshifts. Here we correct some of the inadequacies of previous catalogs by providing: (1) coordinates with <{\~{}}2 arcsec errors for all of the Nuzc catalog galaxies, (2) homogeneously estimated redshifts for the majority (98{\%}) of the data taken at the CfA (14,632 spectra), and (3) an estimate of the remaining "blunder" rate for both the CfA redshifts and for those compiled from the literature. For the reanalyzed CfA data we include a calibrated, uniformly determined error and an indication of the presence of emission lines in each spectrum. We provide redshifts for 7,257 galaxies in the CfA2 redshift survey not previously published; for another 5,625 CfA redshifts we list the remeasured or uniformly re-reduced value. Among our new measurements, Nmul are members of UZC "multiplets" associated with the original Zwicky catalog position in the coordinate range where the catalog is 98{\%} complete. These multiplets provide new candidates for examination of tidal interactions among galaxies.

The sample covers a large range in effective surface brightness, from values typical of genuine dwarfs to those of compact, M 32-like, ellipticals. In contrast to what may be expected from the extrapolation of the result of Davies et al. (1983), about half of the objects are not rotationally flattened. However, only objects fainter than M(T) = -18.0 mag and having low surface brightness are considerably anisotropic, indicating that: (1) the result of Davies et al. (1983) still describes the overall trend between kinematics and luminosity for elliptical galaxies brighter than M(T) = -18 mag in the correct way, and (2) low surface brightness dwarf ellipsoidals may be in general not rotationally flattened.},

abstract = {The authors study some aspects of the evolution of compact M32-type elliptical galaxies (cEs) during their orbital decay onto a massive neighbour. For a typical cE, they find a very slow orbital decay rate: about a few kpc per 109yr. The present mass loss is small, ≡1 - 10 M{\_}sun;/year. The merging of cEs into their massive neighbour should happen within 109 and 1010yr. The small mass loss during the decay implies that progenitors of cEs had already a low-mass when they arose in the vicinity of the massive neighbour, either as formed there or after being captured by it. The authors argue that, in the capture case also, the progenitors were formed with a low mass, ranging between a few times 109 and a few times 1010M{\_}sun;. This gives strong support for cEs to be related to the low mass end of the luminosity function of elliptical galaxies: in particular, cEs could not have evolved from massive ellipticals via tidal stripping. Therefore isolated low-mass ellipticals should exist, that resemble cEs.},

Methods: We report here the discovery of A496cE, a M32 twin in the cluster Abell 496, located in the halo of the central cD. Results: Based on CFHT and HST imaging we show that the light profile of A496cE requires a two component fit: a Sersic bulge and an exponential disc. The spectrum of A496cE obtained with the ESO-VLT FLAMES/Giraffe spectrograph can be fit by a stellar synthesis spectrum dominated by old stars, with high values of [Mg/Fe] and velocity dispersion. Conclusions: The capture of A496cE by the cD galaxy and tidal stripping of most of its disc are briefly discussed.},

abstract = {We have combined UV to radio centimetric observations of resolved galaxies in the Virgo cluster with multizone, chemo-spectrophotometric models of galaxy evolution especially tailored to take into account the effects of the cluster environment (ram pressure stripping and starvation). This exercise has shown that anemic spirals with truncated radial profiles of the gas component and of the young stellar populations, typical in rich clusters of galaxies, have been perturbed by a recent (˜100 Myr) ram pressure stripping event induced by their interaction with the cluster intergalactic medium. Starvation is not able to reproduce the observed truncated radial profiles. Both ram pressure and starvation induce a decrease of the stellar surface brightness of the perturbed disc, and thus can hardly be invoked to explain the formation of lenticular galaxies inhabiting rich clusters, which are characterised by higher surface brightnesses than early type spirals of similar luminosity. In dwarfs the ram pressure stripping event is so efficient to totally remove their gas thus stopping on short time scales ({\&}lt;2 Gyr) their star formation activity. Low luminosity star forming discs can be transformed in dE galaxies.},

abstract = {Based on a comparison of dynamical models with observations of the interstellar gas in 6 Virgo cluster spiral galaxies a first complete ram pressure stripping time sequence has been established. The observational characteristics of the different stages of ram pressure stripping are presented. The dynamical models yield the 3D velocity vectors of the galaxies, peak ram pressures, and times to peak ram pressure. In the case of a smooth, static, and spherical intracluster medium, peak ram pressure occurs during the galaxy's closest approach to the cluster center, i.e. when the galaxy's velocity vector is perpendicular to its distance vector from the cluster center (M 87). Assuming this condition the galaxy's present line-of-sight distance and its 3D position during peak ram pressure can be calculated. The linear orbital segments derived in this way together with the intracluster medium density distribution derived from X-ray observations give estimates of the ram pressure that are on average a factor of 2 higher than derived from the dynamical simulations for NGC 4501, NGC 4330, and NGC 4569. Resolving this discrepancy would require either a 2 times higher intracluster medium density than derived from X-ray observations, or a 2 times higher stripping efficiency than assumed by the dynamical models. Compared to NGC 4501, NGC 4330, and NGC 4569, NGC 4388 requires a still 2 times higher local intracluster medium density or a direction which is moderately different from that derived from the dynamical model. A possible scenario for the dynamical evolution of NGC 4438 and M 86 within the Virgo cluster is presented.},

abstract = {Growing evidence has been accumulated for that some gas-rich dwarf galaxies are formed from material liberated by galaxy collisions and/or mergers. Also, gas-poor dwarf elliptical galaxies are often found in the central regions of clusters of galaxies. These observations suggest strongly that the formation of most dwarf galaxies is linked to galaxy interactions. Therefore, now seems like the right time to investigate the formation efficiency of such tidal dwarf galaxies. Adopting the galaxy interaction scenario proposed by Silk {\&} Norman, we find that if only a few dwarf galaxies are formed in each galaxy collision, we are able to explain the observed morphology-density relations for both dwarf and giant galaxies in the field, groups of galaxies, and clusters of galaxies. It seems worthwhile noting that the tidal dwarf formation may be coupled with the transformation from gas-rich disk galaxies to early-type galaxies such as S0 and elliptical galaxies.},

The structural parameters of the cEs are derived using GALFIT, giving effective radii, Re, of 388 and 263 parsecs, and B-band mean surface brightnesses within Re of 19.4 and 19.2 magnitudes per arcsec squared. We have re-analysed the SDSS spectra, which indicate that they possess young to intermediate-age stellar populations. These two cEs provide direct evidence, a "smoking gun", for the process of tidal stripping that is believed to be the origin of M32-type galaxies. Both are in small groups with a large spiral fraction, suggesting that we may be seeing the formation of such cE galaxies in dynamically young environments. The more compact of the galaxies is found in a small group not unlike the Local Group, and thus provides an additional model for understanding M32.},

abstract = {We investigate the interaction history of the M31 sub-group of galaxies by comparing surface photometry of its two nearest satellites, M32 and NGC 205, with N-body simulations of satellite destruction. The recent discovery of a giant stream in M31's outer halo, apparently pointed towards M32 and NGC 205, makes such an investigation particularly relevant. The observational component of this study is based on 1.7 x 5.0 degree B- and I- band CCD mosaic images centered on M31 and covering both satellites. The simulation component of this project is based on the analysis of single-component, spherical model satellites that are tidally disrupted through interactions with their parent galaxy. Generic features of the simulations include an excess in the surface brightness profile at large radii, a depletion zone at intermediate radii, and isophotal elongation and twists that are coincident with breaks in the brightness profile. The satellites M32 and NGC 205 display most of these features consistently across the B and I bands, strongly suggestive of tidal interaction and probable stripping by M31. We discuss what these observed features can tell us about the satellites' orbital parameters and histories. Specifically, M32 is found to be on a highly eccentric orbit and away from pericenter. Investigating M32's unusual combination of high surface brightness and low luminosity (the hallmark of compact ellipticals), we conclude on empirical grounds that M32 is not likely to be the residual core of a tidally-stripped normal elliptical galaxy as has been suggested, but rather that its precursor was intrinsically compact.},

Since M32 lies in close proximity to the massive spiral M31, its structure has been modified by tidal effects due to M31. Such effects may also account for peculiarities in brightness profiles of several other dwarf elliptical companions to large galaxies. Because of their unusual appearance, these companions are considered as a separate structural class, i.e., compact ellipticals. The present investigation is based on the assumption that the types of dwarf elliptical galaxies seen in the Local Group provide a representative sample of low luminosity ellipticals.

abstract = {New surface photometry of all known elliptical galaxies in the Virgo cluster is added to published data to derive composite profiles over large dynamic ranges. Sersic functions fit them remarkably well. Effective brightnesses and radii are derived via Sersic fits and by integrating the profiles nonparametrically. We strongly confirm two dichotomies: (1) Elliptical galaxies from cDs to M32 form a tight sequence in Fundamental Plane parameter space that is almost perpendicular to the sequence of spheroidal galaxies from NGC 205 to Draco. This is consistent with our understanding of their different formation processes: mergers for Es and conversion of late-type galaxies into spheroidals by environmental effects and by energy feedback from supernovae. (2) Ellipticals come in two varieties: e.g., our 10 brightest Es have cuspy cores; our 17 fainter Es do not have cores. We find a new distinct component in coreless Es. All have extra light at the center above the inward extrapolation of the outer Sersic profile. We suggest that extra light is made by starbursts in dissipational (wet) mergers, as in numerical simulations. Three other new aspects also point to an explanation of how the E-E dichotomy formed: extra light Es were made in wet mergers while core Es were made in dry mergers. We confirm that core Es do and extra light Es generally do not contain X-ray gas. This suggests why the E-E dichotomy arose. Only core Es and their progenitors are massive enough to retain hot gas that can make dry mergers dry and protect old star populations from late star formation.},

abstract = {We update van den Bergh's parallel sequence galaxy classification in which S0 galaxies form a sequence S0a-S0b-S0c that parallels the sequence Sa-Sb-Sc of spiral galaxies. The ratio B/T of bulge to total light defines the position of a galaxy in each sequence. Our classification makes one improvement. We extend the S0a-S0b-S0c sequence to spheroidal ("Sph'") galaxies that are positioned in parallel to irregular galaxies in a similarly extended Sa-Sb-Sc-Im sequence. This provides a natural "home" for spheroidals, which previously were omitted from galaxy classifications. To motivate our juxtaposition of Sph and irregular galaxies, we present photometry and bulge-disk decompositions of Virgo S0s, including late-type S0s that bridge the gap between S0b and Sph galaxies. NGC 4762 is a SB0bc with B/T = 0.13. NGC 4452 is a SB0c galaxy with an even tinier pseudobulge. VCC 2048 and NGC 4638 have properties of both S0cs and Sphs. We update the structural parameter correlations Sphs, irregulars, bulges, and disks. We show that spheroidals of increasing luminosity form a continuous sequence with the disks (but not bulges) of S0c-S0b-S0a galaxies. Remarkably, the Sph--S0-disk sequence is almost identical to that of irregular galaxies and spiral galaxy disks. We review published observations for galaxy transformation processes, particularly ram-pressure stripping of cold gas. We suggest that Sph galaxies are transformed, "red and dead" Scd--Im galaxies in the same way that many S0 galaxies are transformed, red and dead Sa-Sc spiral galaxies},

These objects are all within 30 arcminutes of the central galaxy of the cluster, NGC 1399, but are distributed over larger radii than the globular cluster system of that galaxy. We suggest that these objects are either super-massive star clusters (intra-cluster globular clusters or tidally stripped nuclei of dwarf galaxies) or a new type of low-luminosity compact elliptical dwarf (M32-type) galaxy. The best way to test these hypotheses will be to obtain high resolution imaging and high-dispersion spectroscopy to determine their structures and mass-to-light ratios. This will allow us to compare them to known compact objects and establish if they represent a new class of hitherto unknown stellar system.},

Using N-body simulations we follow the evolution of disc galaxies within a $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cluster simulated with 107 particles, where the hierarchical growth and galaxy harassment are modelled self-consistently. Most of the galaxies undergo significant morphological transformation, even at the outskirts of the cluster, and move through the Hubble sequence from late-type discs to dwarf spheroidals. None of the discs is completely destroyed, therefore they cannot be the progenitors of ultracompact dwarf (UCD) galaxies. The time evolution of the simulated galaxies is compared with unsharp masked images obtained from Very Large Telescope (VLT) data and the projected kinematics of our models with the latest high-resolution spectroscopic studies from the Keck and Palomar telescopes.},

abstract = {We report the discovery of an Ultra Compact Dwarf (UCD) associated with the Sombrero galaxy (M104). This is the closest massive UCD known and the first spectroscopically verified massive UCD which is located in a low density environment.   The object, we name SUCD1, was identified in HST/ACS imaging and confirmed to be associated with the Sombrero galaxy by its recession velocity obtained from Keck spectra. The light profile is well fitted by a Wilson model. We measure a half light size of 14.7 +/- 1.4 pc, an absolute magnitude of M{\_}V = -12.3 mag (M{\_}K = -15.1 mag) and an internal velocity dispersion of 25.0 +/- 5.6 km/s. Such values are typical of UCDs. From Lick spectral indices we measure a luminosity-weighted central age of 12.6 +/- 0.9 Gyrs, [Fe/H] of -0.08 +/- 0.08 dex and [alpha/Fe] of 0.06 +/- 0.07 dex. The lack of colour gradients suggests these values are representative of the entire UCD. The derived stellar and virial masses are the same, within errors, at {\~{}}3.3 x 10E7 Msun. Thus we find no strong evidence for dark matter or the need to invoke a non-standard IMF.   We also report arguably the first X-ray detection of a bona fide UCD, which we attribute to the presence of Low-Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs). The X-ray luminosity of L{\_}X = 0.56 x 10E38 erg/s is consistent with the values observed for GCs of the same metallicity. Overall we find SUCD1 has properties similar to other known UCDs and massive GCs.},

abstract = {The relation between the size and luminosity for both bright and faint early-type galaxies has been repeatedly discussed as a crucial proxy for understanding evolutionary scenarios, as galaxies grow and lose their stellar mass in different physical processes. The class of compact early-type galaxies (cEs) are, however, distinct outliers from this relation and mainly found around massive galaxies in the centres of groups and clusters. The recent discovery of a cE in isolation provided a new opportunity to understand their formation scenario in a different environment. Here, we report the discovery of an isolated cE, CGCG 036-042, using imagery from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The CGCG 036-042 has an {\$}r{\$}-band absolute magnitude (M{\$}{\_}{\{}r{\}}{\$}) of {\$}-{\$}18.21 mag and a half-light radius (R{\$}{\_}{\{}e{\}}{\$}) of 559 pc. Interestingly, it possesses a faint outer stellar component, which extends up to 10 kpc from its centre and has a nearly constant {\$}r{\$}-band surface brightness of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}26 mag/arcsec{\$}{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}{\$}. ESO-VLT long-slit spectroscopic data reveal that the simple stellar population (SSP) properties are fairly similar to those of previously identified cEs, with an intermediate-age of 7.15{\$}\backslashpm{\$}1.17 Gyr, a metallicity of --0.18{\$}\backslashpm{\$}0.07 dex and a supersolar alpha-element abundance of 0.2{\$}\backslashpm{\$}0.05 dex. The SSP metallicity also shows a significant decline outward from the center, by 0.5 dex over one half light radius. We discuss the possible origin of this galaxy and suggest that it might have originated from a merger of even smaller objects -- a well established scenario for the formation of massive early-type galaxies.},

abstract = {We use imaging from the Next Generation Virgo cluster Survey (NGVS) to present a comparative study of ultra-compact dwarf (UCD) galaxies associated with three prominent Virgo sub-clusters: those centered on the massive, red-sequence galaxies M87, M49 and M60. We show how UCDs can be selected with high completeness using a combination of half-light radius and location in color-color diagrams ({\$}u{\^{}}*iK{\_}s{\$} or {\$}u{\^{}}*gz{\$}). Although the central galaxies in each of these sub-clusters have nearly identical luminosities and stellar masses, we find large differences in the sizes of their UCD populations, with M87 containing {\~{}}3.5 and 7.8 times more UCDs than M49 and M60, respectively. The relative abundance of UCDs in the three regions scales in proportion to sub-cluster mass, as traced by X-ray gas mass, total gravitating mass, number of globular clusters, and number of nearby galaxies. We find that the UCDs are predominantly blue in color, with {\~{}}85{\%} of the UCDs having colors similar to blue GCs and stellar nuclei of dwarf galaxies. We present evidence that UCDs surrounding M87 and M49 may follow a morphological sequence ordered by the prominence of their outer, low surface brightness envelope, ultimately merging with the sequence of nucleated low-mass galaxies, and that envelope prominence correlates with distance from either galaxy. Our analysis provides evidence that tidal stripping of nucleated galaxies is an important process in the formation of UCDs.},

abstract = {How did the dwarf galaxy population of present-day galaxy clusters form and grow over time? We address this question by analysing the history of dark matter subhaloes in the Millennium-II cosmological simulation. A semi-analytic model serves as the link to observations. We argue that a reasonable analogue to early morphological types or red-sequence dwarf galaxies are those subhaloes that experienced strong mass loss, or alternatively those that have spent a long time in massive haloes. This approach reproduces well the observed morphology-distance relation of dwarf galaxies in the Virgo and Coma clusters, and thus provides insight into their history. Over their lifetime, present-day late types have experienced an amount of environmental influence similar to what the progenitors of dwarf ellipticals had already experienced at redshifts above two. Therefore, dwarf ellipticals are more likely to be a result of early and continuous environmental influence in group- and cluster-size haloes, rather than a recent transformation product. The observed morphological sequences of late-type and early-type galaxies have developed in parallel, not consecutively. Consequently, the characteristics of today's late-type galaxies are not necessarily representative for the progenitors of today's dwarf ellipticals. Studies aiming to reproduce the present-day dwarf population thus need to start at early epochs, model the influence of various environments, and also take into account the evolution of the environments themselves.},

Among the unresolved or marginally resolved targets, we have found five objects that are actually at the redshift of the Fornax Cluster; i.e., they are extremely compact dwarf galaxies or extremely large star clusters. All five have absorption-line spectra. With intrinsic sizes of less than 1.1" HWHM (corresponding to approximately 100 pc at the distance of the cluster), they are more compact and significantly less luminous than other known compact dwarf galaxies, yet much brighter than any globular cluster. In this paper we present new ground-based optical observations of these enigmatic objects. In addition to having extremely high central surface brightnesses, these objects show no evidence of any surrounding low surface brightness envelopes down to much fainter limits than is the case for, e.g., nucleated dwarf elliptical galaxies. Thus, if they are not merely the stripped remains of some other type of galaxy, then they appear to have properties unlike any previously known type of stellar system.},

abstract = {Keck/ESI spectroscopy is presented for six Virgo Cluster dwarf elliptical (dE) galaxies. The mean line-of-sight velocity and velocity dispersion are resolved as a function of radius along the major axis of each galaxy, nearly doubling the total number of dEs with spatially-resolved stellar kinematics. None of the observed objects shows evidence of strong rotation: upper limits on v{\_}rot/sigma are well below those expected for rotationally-flattened objects. Such limits place strong constraints on dE galaxy formation models. Although these galaxies continue the trend of low rotation velocities observed in Local Group dEs, they are in contrast to recent observations of large rotation velocities in slightly brighter cluster dEs. Using WFPC2 surface photometry and spherically-symmetric dynamical models, we determine global mass-to-light ratios 3 < M/L{\_}V < 6. These ratios are comparable to those expected for an intermediate-age stellar population and are broadly consistent with the (V-I) colors of the galaxies. This implies that these dEs do not have a significant dark matter component inside an effective radius. Central black holes more massive than 10{\^{}}7 M{\_}sun can be ruled out. For the 5 nucleated dEs in our sample, we determine kinematic and photometric properties for the central nucleus separately from the underlying host dE galaxy. These nuclei are as bright or brighter than the most luminous Galactic globular clusters and lie near the region of Fundamental Plane space occupied by globular clusters. In this space, the Virgo dE galaxies lie in the same general region as Local Group and other nearby dEs, although non-rotating dEs appear to have a slightly higher mean mass and mass-to-light ratio than their rotating counterparts.},

Another goal of this study is to find candidates for ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) in Hydra I.  Methods: Two spectroscopic surveys performed with Magellan I/LDSS2 at Las Campanas Observatory and VLT/VIMOS, as well as deep VLT/FORS1 images in V and I bands, covering the central parts of the cluster, were examined. We identify cluster members by radial velocity measurements and select other cluster galaxy candidates by their morphology and low surface brightness. The candidates' total magnitudes and central surface brightnesses were derived from the analysis of their surface brightness profiles. To determine the faint-end slope of the LF, the galaxy number counts are completeness corrected.  Results: We obtain radial velocities for 126 objects and identify 32 cluster members, of which 5 are previously uncatalogued dwarf galaxies. One possible UCD candidate with MV = -13.26 mag is found. Our sample of ≃100 morphologically selected dwarf galaxies with M{\_}V{\&}gt;-17 mag defines a CMR that extends the CMR of the giant cluster galaxies to the magnitude limit of our survey (MV {\~{}} -10 mag). It matches the relations found for the Local Group (LG) and the Fornax cluster dwarf galaxies almost perfectly. The Hydra I dwarf galaxies also follow a magnitude-surface brightness relation that is very similar to that of the LG dwarf galaxies. Moreover, we observe a continuous relation for dwarf galaxies and giant early-type galaxies when plotting the central surface brightness $\mu$0 of a S{\'{e}}rsic model vs. the galaxy magnitude. The effective radius is found to be largely independent of the luminosity for MV {\&}gt; -18 mag. It is consistent with a constant value of Re {\~{}} 0.8 kpc. We present the photometric parameters of the galaxies as the Hydra I Cluster Catalogue (HCC). By fitting a Schechter function to the luminosity distribution, we derive a very flat faint-end slope of the LF ($\alpha$ = -1.13 ± 0.04), whereas fitting a power law for MV {\&}gt; -14 mag gives $\alpha$ = -1.40 ± 0.18.  Conclusions: Our findings of a continuous CMR and $\mu$0 - MV relation for dwarf and giant early-type galaxies suggests that they are the same class of objects. The similarity of those relations to other environments like the LG implies that internal processes could be more important for their global photometric properties than external influences.

abstract = {We have discovered both a red and a blue subpopulation of ultra-compact dwarf (UCD) galaxy candidates in the Coma galaxy cluster. We analyzed deep F475W (Sloan g) and F814W (I) Hubble Space Telescope images obtained with the Advanced Camera for Surveys Wide Field Channel as part of the Coma Cluster Treasury Survey and have fitted the light profiles of {\~{}}5000 point-like sources in the vicinity of NGC 4874, one of the two central dominant galaxies of the Coma Cluster. Although almost all of these sources are globular clusters that remain unresolved, we found that 52 objects have effective radii between {\~{}}10 and 66 pc, in the range spanned by dwarf globular transition objects (DGTOs) and UCDs. Of these 52 compact objects, 25 are brighter than MV {\~{}} -11 mag, a magnitude conventionally thought to separate UCDs and globular clusters. The UCD/DGTO candidates have the same color and luminosity distribution as the most luminous globular clusters within the red and blue subpopulations of the immensely rich NGC 4874 globular cluster system. Unlike standard globular clusters, blue and red UCD/DGTO subpopulations have the same median effective radius. The spatial distribution of UCD/DGTO candidates reveals that they congregate toward NGC 4874 and are not uniformly distributed. We find a relative deficit of UCD/DGTOs compared with globular clusters in the inner 15 kpc around NGC 4874 however, at larger radii UCD/DGTO and globular clusters follow the same spatial distribution.

abstract = {The Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys (HST/ACS) Coma Cluster Treasury Survey is a deep two-passband imaging survey of the nearest very rich cluster of galaxies, covering a range of galaxy density environments. The imaging is complemented by a recent wide field redshift survey of the cluster conducted with Hectospec on the 6.5-m Monolithic Mirror Telescope (MMT). Among the many scientific applications for these data is the search for compact galaxies. In this paper, we present the discovery of seven compact (but quite luminous) stellar systems, ranging from M32-like galaxies down to ultra-compact dwarfs (UCDs)/dwarf to globular transition objects (DGTOs).  We find that all seven compact galaxies require a two-component fit to their light profile and have measured velocity dispersions that exceed those expected for typical early-type galaxies at their luminosity. From our structural parameter analysis, we conclude that three of the samples should be classified as compact ellipticals or M32-like galaxies, and the remaining four being less extreme systems. The three compact ellipticals are all found to have old luminosity weighted ages ({\&}gt;{\~{}}12 Gyr), intermediate metallicities (-0.6 {\&}lt; [Fe/H] {\&}lt; -0.1) and high [Mg/Fe] ({\&}gt;{\~{}}0.25).  Our findings support a tidal stripping scenario as the formation mode of compact galaxies covering the luminosity range studied here. We speculate that at least two early-type morphologies may serve as the progenitor of compact galaxies in clusters.},

abstract = {We have discovered nine ultracompact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) in the Virgo Cluster, extending samples of these objects outside the Fornax Cluster. Using the Two Degree Field (2dF) multifiber spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope, the new Virgo members were found among 1500 color-selected, starlike targets with 16.0{\&}lt;bj{\&}lt;20.2 in a 2° diameter field centered on M87 (NGC 4486). The newly found UCDs are comparable to the UCDs in the Fornax Cluster, with sizes {\&}lt;{\~{}}100 pc, -12.9{\&}lt;MB{\&}lt;-10.7, and exhibiting red absorption-line spectra, indicative of an older stellar population. The properties of these objects remain consistent with the tidal threshing model for the origin of UCDs from the surviving nuclei of nucleated dwarf elliptical galaxies disrupted in the cluster core but can also be explained as objects that were formed by mergers of star clusters created in galaxy interactions. The discovery that UCDs exist in Virgo shows that this galaxy type is probably a ubiquitous phenomenon in clusters of galaxies; coupled with their possible origin by tidal threshing, the UCD population is a potential indicator and probe of the formation history of a given cluster. We also describe one additional bright UCD with MB=-12.0 in the core of the Fornax Cluster. We find no further UCDs in our Fornax Cluster Spectroscopic Survey down to bj=19.5 in two additional 2dF fields extending as far as 3° from the center of the cluster. All six Fornax bright UCDs identified with 2dF lie within 0.5d (projected distance of 170 kpc) of the central elliptical galaxy NGC 1399.},

abstract = {We investigate the connection between globular clusters and ultracompact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) by examining the properties of 10 compact, high-luminosity (-11.8  MV  -10.8) objects associated with M87 (NGC 4486, VCC 1316), the cD galaxy in the Virgo Cluster. These objects, most of which were previously classified as M87 globular clusters, were selected from a combination of ground- and space-based imaging surveys. Our observational database for these objects - which we term DGTOs, or "dwarf-globular transition objects" - includes Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) F475W and F850LP imaging from the ACS Virgo Cluster Survey, integrated-light spectroscopy from Keck/ESI, and archival F606W WFPC2 imaging. We also present a search for DGTOs associated with other galaxies based on ACS imaging for 100 early-type galaxies in Virgo. Our main findings can be summarized as follows:  1. Of the six DGTOs in M87 with both ground-based spectroscopy and HST imaging, we find two objects to have half-light radii, velocity dispersions, and mass-to-light ratios that are consistent with the predictions of population synthesis models for old, metal-rich, high-luminosity globular clusters.  2. Three other DGTOs are much larger, with half-light radii rh {\~{}} 20 pc, and have V-band mass-to-light ratios in the range 6  M/LV  9. These objects, which we consider to be UCDs, resemble the nuclei of nucleated dwarf elliptical galaxies in the Virgo Cluster, having similar mass-to-light ratios, luminosities, and colors.  3. The classification of the sixth object is more uncertain, but it bears a strong resemblance to simulated "stellar superclusters," which are presumed to form through the amalgamation of multiple young massive clusters.  4. In general, the UCDs in M87 are found to follow the extrapolated scaling relations of galaxies more closely than those of globular clusters. There appears to be a transition between the two types of stellar systems at a mass of  2 × 10{\^{}}6 M. We suggest that the presence of dark matter is the fundamental property distinguishing globular clusters from UCDs.  5. We identify a sample of 13 DGTO candidates from the complete ACS Virgo Cluster Survey, selecting on the basis of half-light radius, magnitude, and color. For a number of these objects, membership in Virgo can be established through radial velocities or surface brightness fluctuation measurements with our ACS images. Three of these DGTO candidates are embedded in low-surface brightness envelopes.  6. Five of the 13 DGTOs in Virgo are associated with a single galaxy: M87. This finding suggests that proximity to the Virgo center may be of critical importance for the formation of these objects, although we find M87 to be more abundant in DGTOs than would be expected on the basis of its luminosity, the size of its globular cluster system, or the local galaxy density.  These results show that distinguishing bona fide UCDs from high-luminosity globular clusters requires a careful analysis of their detailed structural and dynamical properties, particularly their mass-to-light ratios. In general, the properties of the UCDs in our sample are consistent with models in which these objects form through tidal stripping of nucleated dwarf galaxies.

abstract = {Radial velocities of 94 galaxies brighter than about V{\_}tot = 20 mag in the direction of the central Fornax cluster have been measured.   Except for 8 Fornax members, all galaxies lie in the background. Among the 8 members, there are 5 nucleated dwarf ellipticals that are already listed in the FCC ($\backslash$cite[Ferguson 1989]{\{}ferg89{\}}). Two of the 3 ``new'' members are very compact and have surface brightnesses comparable to globular clusters, however their luminosities are in the range of dwarf elliptical nuclei. The measured line indices (especially Mg2, H$\beta$ , and iron) of the brighter of the compact objects suggest a solar metallicity, whereas the fainter compact object as well as the dE, Ns have line indices that are similar to those of old metal-poor globular clusters (GCs). However, with these data it is not possible to clearly classify the compact objects either as very bright globular clusters, isolated nuclei of dE, Ns, or even compact ellipticals. A background galaxy cluster at z = 0.11 has been found just behind the center of the Fornax cluster. This explains the excess population of galaxies reported in Paper I. The brightest galaxy of the background cluster lies only 1farcm1 south of NGC 1399 and is comparable in absolute luminosity with the central Fornax galaxy itself.

The question was adressed whether the UCOs constitute a distinct population of objects not linked to globular clusters or whether there is a smooth transition between both populations. Therefore, a spectroscopic survey on compact objects in the central region of the Fornax cluster was carried out with the 2.5 m du Pont telescope (LCO). UCOs and the bright NGC 1399 globular clusters with similar brightness were inspected. 12 GCs from the bright end of the globular cluster luminosity function have been identified as Fornax members. Eight are new members, four were known as members from before. Their magnitude distribution supports a smooth transition between the faint UCOs and the bright globular clusters. There is no evidence for a magnitude gap between both populations. However, the brightest UCO clearly stands out; it is too bright and too large to be accounted for by globular clusters. For the only UCO included in our survey, a relatively high metallicity of [Fe/H] ={\~{}} -0.5 dex is measured.},

The Galactic tidal force can induce radial inflow of gas to the dwarf's center and consequently triggers moderately strong nuclear starbursts in a repetitive manner.

In order to elucidate the origin of these enigmatic objects, we perform numerical simulations on the dynamical evolution of nucleated dwarf galaxies orbiting NGC 1399 and suffering from its strong tidal gravitational field. Adopting a plausible scaling relation for dwarf galaxies, we find that the outer stellar components of a nucleated dwarf are totally removed. This is due to them being tidally stripped over the course of several passages past the central region of NGC 1399. The nucleus, however, manages to survive. We also find that the size and luminosity of the remnant are similar to those observed for ultra-compact dwarf galaxies, if the simulated precursor nucleated dwarf has a mass of {\$}\backslashsim{\$} {\$}10{\^{}}8{\$} {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}.

Distant clusters at {\$}z \backslashsim 0.4{\$} are filled with small spiral galaxies, many of which are disturbed and show evidence of multiple bursts of star-formation. This population is absent from nearby clusters where spheroidals comprise the faint end of the luminosity function. Our numerical simulations follow the evolution of disk galaxies in a rich cluster owing to encounters with brighter galaxies and the cluster's tidal field---galaxy harassment. After a bursting transient phase, they undergo a complete morphological transformation from "disks" to"spheroidals". We examine the remnants and find support for our theory in detailed comparisons of the photometry and kinematics of the spheroidal galaxies in clusters. Our model naturally accounts for the intermediate age stellar population seen in these spheroidals as well as the trend in dwarf to giant ratio with cluster richness. The final shapes are typically prolate and are flattened primarily by velocity anisotropy. Their mass to light ratios are in the range 3---8 in good agreement with observations.},

abstract = {How did the dwarf galaxy population of present-day galaxy clusters form and grow over time? We address this question by analysing the history of dark matter subhaloes in the Millennium II cosmological simulation. A semi-analytic model serves as the link to observations. We argue that a reasonable analogue to early morphological types or red-sequence dwarf galaxies are those subhaloes that experienced strong mass-loss, or alternatively those that have spent a long time in massive haloes. This approach reproduces well the observed morphology-distance relation of dwarf galaxies in the Virgo and Coma clusters, and thus provides insight into their history. Over their lifetime, present-day late types have experienced an amount of environmental influence similar to what the progenitors of dwarf ellipticals had already experienced at redshifts above 2. Therefore, dwarf ellipticals are more likely to be a result of early and continuous environmental influence in group- and cluster-size haloes, rather than a recent transformation product. The observed morphological sequences of late-type and early-type galaxies have developed in parallel, not consecutively. Consequently, the characteristics of today's late-type galaxies are not necessarily representative for the progenitors of today's dwarf ellipticals. Studies aiming to reproduce the present-day dwarf population thus need to start at early epochs, model the influence of various environments, and also take into account the evolution of the environments themselves.},

abstract = {We update van den Bergh's parallel-sequence galaxy classification in which S0 galaxies form a sequence S0a-S0b-S0c that parallels the sequence Sa-Sb-Sc of spiral galaxies. The ratio B/T of bulge-to-total light defines the position of a galaxy in this tuning-fork diagram. Our classification makes one major improvement. We extend the S0a-S0b-S0c sequence to spheroidal ("Sph") galaxies that are positioned in parallel to irregular galaxies in a similarly extended Sa-Sb-Sc-Im sequence. This provides a natural "home" for spheroidals, which previously were omitted from galaxy classification schemes or inappropriately combined with ellipticals. To motivate our juxtaposition of Sph and Im galaxies, we present photometry and bulge-disk decompositions of four rare, late-type S0s that bridge the gap between the more common S0b and Sph galaxies. NGC 4762 is an edge-on SB0bc galaxy with a very small classical-bulge-to-total ratio of B/T = 0.13 ± 0.02. NGC 4452 is an edge-on SB0 galaxy with an even tinier pseudobulge-to-total ratio of PB/T = 0.017 ± 0.004. It is therefore an SB0c. VCC 2048, whose published classification is S0, contains an edge-on disk, but its "bulge" plots in the structural parameter sequence of spheroidals. It is therefore a disky Sph. And NGC 4638 is similarly a "missing link" between S0s and Sphs—it has a tiny bulge and an edge-on disk embedded in an Sph halo. In the Appendix, we present photometry and bulge-disk decompositions of all Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys Virgo Cluster Survey S0s that do not have published decompositions. We use these data to update the structural parameter correlations of Sph, S+Im, and E galaxies. We show that Sph galaxies of increasing luminosity form a continuous sequence with the disks (but not bulges) of S0c-S0b-S0a galaxies. Remarkably, the Sph-S0-disk sequence is almost identical to that of Im galaxies and spiral galaxy disks. We review published observations for galaxy transformation processes, particularly ram-pressure stripping of cold gas. We suggest that Sph galaxies are transformed, "red and dead" Scd-Im galaxies in the same way that many S0 galaxies are transformed, red and dead Sa-Sc spiral galaxies.},

abstract = {Ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) and dwarf galaxy nuclei have many common properties, such as internal velocity dispersions and colour-magnitude trends, suggesting tidally stripped dwarf galaxies as a possible UCD origin. However, UCDs typically have sizes more than twice as large as nuclei at the same luminosity. We use a graphics processing unit (GPU)-enabled version of the particle-mesh code SUPERBOX to study the possibility of turning nucleated dwarf galaxies into UCDs by tidally stripping them in a Virgo-like galaxy cluster. We find that motion in spherical potentials, where close passages happen many times, leads to the formation of compact (rh ≲ 20 pc) star clusters/UCDs. In contrast, orbital motion where close passages happen only once or twice leads to the formation of extended objects which are large enough to account for the full range of observed UCD sizes. For such motion, we find that dwarf galaxies need close pericentre passages with distances less than 10 kpc to undergo strong enough stripping so that UCD formation is possible. As tidal stripping produces objects with similar properties to UCDs, and our estimates suggest dwarf galaxies have been destroyed in sufficient numbers to explain the observed number of UCDs in M87, we consider tidal stripping to be a likely origin of UCDs. However, comparison with cosmological simulations is needed to determine if the number and spatial distribution of UCDs formed by tidal stripping matches the observations of UCDs in galaxy clusters.},

abstract = {We exploit data from the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS) to study the extended structures of M31's dwarf elliptical companions, NGC147 and NGC185. Our wide-field, homogeneous photometry allows to construct deep colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) which reach down to {\$}\backslashsim3{\$} mag below the red giant branch (RGB) tip. We trace the stellar components of the galaxies to surface brightness of {\$}\backslashmu{\_}g \backslashsim 32{\$} mag arcsec{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$} and show they have much larger extents ({\$}\backslashsim5{\$} kpc radii) than previously recognised. While NGC185 retains a regular shape in its peripheral regions, NGC147 exhibits pronounced isophotal twisting due to the emergence of symmetric tidal tails. We fit single Sersic models to composite surface brightness profiles constructed from diffuse light and star counts and find that NGC147 has an effective radius almost 3 times that of NGC185. In both cases, the effective radii that we calculate are larger by a factor of {\$}\backslashsim2{\$} compared to most literature values. We also calculate revised total magnitudes of {\$}M{\_}g=-15.36\backslashpm0.04{\$} for NGC185 and {\$}M{\_}g=-16.36\backslashpm0.04{\$} for NGC147. Using photometric metallicities computed for RGB stars, we find NGC185 to exhibit a metallicity gradient of [Fe/H]{\$}\backslashsim-0.15{\$} dex/kpc over the radial range 0.125 to 0.5 deg. On the other hand, NGC147 exhibits almost no metallicity gradient, {\$}\backslashsim-0.02{\$} dex/kpc from 0.2 to 0.6 deg. The differences in the structure and stellar populations in the outskirts of these systems suggest that tidal influences have played an important role in governing the evolution of NGC147.},

abstract = {The origin of ultra-compact dwarfs (UCDs)--objects larger and more massive than typical globular clusters (GCs), but more compact than typical dwarf galaxies--has been hotly debated in the 15 years since their discovery. Even whether UCDs should be considered galactic in origin, or simply the most extreme GCs, is not yet settled. We present the dynamical properties of 97 spectroscopically confirmed UCDs (rh >{\~{}}10 pc) and 911 GCs associated with central cD galaxy of the Virgo cluster, M87. Our UCDs, of which 89{\%} have M{\_}star > {\~{}}2X10{\^{}}6 M{\_}sun and 92{\%} are as blue as the classic blue GCs, nearly triple the sample of previous confirmed Virgo UCDs, providing by far the best opportunity for studying the global dynamics of a UCD system. We found that (1) UCDs have a surface number density profile that is shallower than that of the blue GCs in the inner {\~{}} 70 kpc and as steep as that of the red GCs at larger radii; (2) UCDs exhibit a significantly stronger rotation than the GCs, and the blue GCs seem to have a velocity field that is more consistent with that of the surrounding dwarf ellipticals than with that of UCDs; (3) UCDs have a radially increasing orbital anisotropy profile, and are tangentially-biased at radii < {\~{}} 40 kpc and radially-biased further out. In contrast, the blue GCs become more tangentially-biased at larger radii beyond {\~{}} 40 kpc; (4) GCs with M{\_}star > 2X10{\^{}}6 M{\_}sun have rotational properties indistinguishable from the less massive ones, suggesting that it is the size, instead of mass, that differentiates UCDs from GCs as kinematically distinct populations. We conclude that most UCDs in M87 are not consistent with being merely the most luminous and extended examples of otherwise normal GCs. The radially-biased orbital structure of UCDs at large radii is in general agreement with the "tidally threshed dwarf galaxy" scenario.},

The resulting F606W and F814W color-magnitude diagrams are the first to reach below the main sequence turnoff in a dE galaxy, allowing us to determine full star formation histories in these systems. The ACS fields are located {\~{}}1.5 effective radii from the galaxy center to avoid photometric crowding. While our ACS pointings in both dEs show unambiguous evidence for old and intermediate age stars, the mean age in NGC 147 is {\~{}} 4 Gyr younger as compared to NGC 185. In NGC 147, only 40{\%} of stars were in place 12.5 Gyrs ago (z{\~{}}5), with the bulk of the remaining stellar population forming between 5 to 7 Gyr. In contrast, 70{\%} of stars were formed in NGC 185 field more than12.5 Gyr ago with the majority of the remaining population forming between 8 to 10 Gyr. Star formation ceased in both ACS fields at least 3 Gyr ago. Previous observations in the central regions of NGC 185 show evidence for star formation as recent as 100 Myr ago and a strong metallicity gradient with radius. We suggest that the orbit of NGC 185 has a larger pericenter as compared to NGC 147, allowing it to preserve radial gradients and maintain a small central reservoir of recycled gas. We interpret the inferred differences in star formation histories to imply an earlier infall time into the M31 environment for NGC 185 as compared to NGC 147.},

They were thought to form through tidal stripping of massive progenitors, until two isolated objects were discovered where massive galaxies performing the stripping could not be identified. By mining astronomical survey data, we have now found 195 compact elliptical galaxies in all types of environment. They all share similar dynamical and stellar population properties. Dynamical analysis for nonisolated galaxies demonstrates the feasibility of their ejection from host clusters and groups by three-body encounters, which is in agreement with numerical simulations. Hence, isolated compact elliptical and isolated quiescent dwarf galaxies are tidally stripped systems that ran away from their hosts.},

abstract = {Luminous Compact Blue Galaxies (LCBGs) are an extreme star-bursting population of galaxies that were far more common at earlier epochs than today. Based on spectroscopic and photometric measurements of LCBGs in massive (M >10{\^{}}15 M{\_}sun), intermediate redshift (0.5 < z < 0.9) galaxy clusters, we present their rest-frame properties including star-formation rate, dynamical mass, size, luminosity, and metallicity. The appearance of these small, compact galaxies in clusters at intermediate redshift helps explain the observed redshift evolution in the size-luminosity relationship among cluster galaxies. In addition, we find the rest-frame properties of LCBGs appearing in galaxy clusters are indistinguishable from field LCBGs at the same redshift. Up to 35{\%} of the LCBGs show significant discrepancies between optical and infrared indicators of star formation, suggesting that star formation occurs in obscured regions. Nonetheless, the star formation for LCBGs shows a decrease toward the center of the galaxy clusters. Based on their position and velocity, we estimate that up to 10{\%} of cluster LCBGs are likely to merge with another cluster galaxy. Finally, the observed properties and distributions of the LCBGs in these clusters lead us to conclude that we are witnessing the quenching of the progenitors of dwarf elliptical galaxies that dominate the number density of present-epoch galaxy clusters.},

abstract = {We present the discovery of several Ultra Compact Dwarfs (UCDs) located in field/group environments. Examination of these objects, plus literature objects, confirms the existence of two distinct formation channels for UCDs. We find that the UCDs we have discovered around the group elliptical NGC3923 (and UCDs generally) have properties consistent with their being the most luminous members of the host galaxy's globular cluster (GC) system. We describe UCDs of this type as giant GCs (GGCs). In contrast, the UCD we have found associated with the isolated S0 NGC4546 is clearly the result of the stripping of a nucleated companion galaxy. The young age ({\~{}}3.4 Gyr) of the UCD, the lack of a correspondingly young GC population, the apparently short dynamical friction decay timescale ({\~{}}0.5 Gyr) of the UCD, and the presence of a counterrotating gas disc in the host galaxy (co-rotating with the UCD) together suggest that this UCD is the liberated nucleus remaining after the recent stripping of a companion by NGC4546. We suggest a general scheme that unifies the formation of GCs, UCDs, and galaxy nuclei. In this picture "normal" GCs are a composite population, composed of GCs formed in situ, GCs acquired from accreted galaxies, and a population of lower mass stripped dwarf nuclei masquerading as GCs. Above a "scaling onset mass" of 2x10{\^{}}6 Msun (Mv {\~{}} -10), UCDs emerge together with a mass-size relation and a likely mass-metallicity relation (the "blue tilt"). In the mass range up to 7x10{\^{}}7 Msun (Mv {\~{}} -13) UCDs comprise a composite population of GGCs and stripped nuclei. Above 7x10{\^{}}7 Msun, UCDs must be almost exclusively stripped nuclei, as no sufficiently rich GC systems exist to populate such an extreme of the GCLF.},

Here we combine a sample of UCDs and cEs with velocity dispersions from the AIMSS project with literature data to explore their dynamical-to-stellar mass ratios.   We confirm that the mass ratios of many UCDs in the stellar mass range 10{\$}{\^{}}6{\$} -- 10{\$}{\^{}}9{\$} M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} are systematically higher than those for globular clusters which have mass ratios near unity.

Suggested explanations for the elevated mass ratios of UCDs have included a variable IMF, a central black hole, and the presence of dark matter. Here we present another possible explanation, i.e. tidal stripping. Under various assumptions, we find that the apparent variation in the mass ratio with stellar mass and stellar density can be qualitatively reproduced by published tidal stripping simulations of a dwarf elliptical galaxy. In the early stages of the stripping process the galaxy is unlikely to be in virial equilibrium. At late stages, the final remnant resembles the properties of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}10{\$}{\^{}}7{\$} M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} UCDs. Finally, we discuss the need for more detailed realistic modelling of tidal stripping over a wider range of parameter space, and observations to further test the stripping hypothesis.},

abstract = {In recent years, a growing zoo of compact stellar systems (CSSs) have been found whose physical properties (mass, size, velocity dispersion) place them between classical globular clusters (GCs) and true galaxies, leading to debates about their nature. Here we present results using a so far underutilised discriminant, their stellar population properties. Based on new spectroscopy from 8-10m telescopes, we derive ages, metallicities, and [$\backslash$alpha/Fe] of 29 CSSs. These range from GCs with sizes of merely a few parsec to compact ellipticals larger than M32. Together with a literature compilation, this provides a panoramic view of the stellar population characteristics of early-type systems. We find that the CSSs are predominantly more metal rich than typical galaxies at the same stellar mass. At high mass, the compact ellipticals (cEs) depart from the mass-metallicity relation of massive early-type galaxies, which forms a continuous sequence with dwarf galaxies. At lower mass, the metallicity distribution of ultra-compact dwarfs (UCDs) changes at a few times {\$}10{\^{}}7{\$} M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}, which roughly coincides with the mass where luminosity function arguments previously suggested the GC population ends. The highest metallicities in CSSs are paralleled only by those of dwarf galaxy nuclei and the central parts of massive early types. These findings can be interpreted as CSSs previously being more massive and undergoing tidal interactions to obtain their current mass and compact size. Such an interpretation is supported by CSSs with direct evidence for tidal stripping, and by an examination of the CSS internal escape velocities.},

abstract = {Ultra-compact dwarf galaxies are among the densest stellar systems in the Universe. These systems have masses of up to 2 × 10(8) solar masses, but half-light radii of just 3-50 parsecs. Dynamical mass estimates show that many such dwarfs are more massive than expected from their luminosity. It remains unclear whether these high dynamical mass estimates arise because of the presence of supermassive black holes or result from a non-standard stellar initial mass function that causes the average stellar mass to be higher than expected. Here we report adaptive optics kinematic data of the ultra-compact dwarf galaxy M60-UCD1 that show a central velocity dispersion peak exceeding 100 kilometres per second and modest rotation. Dynamical modelling of these data reveals the presence of a supermassive black hole with a mass of 2.1 × 10(7) solar masses. This is 15 per cent of the object's total mass. The high black hole mass and mass fraction suggest that M60-UCD1 is the stripped nucleus of a galaxy. Our analysis also shows that M60-UCD1's stellar mass is consistent with its luminosity, implying a large population of previously unrecognized supermassive black holes in other ultra-compact dwarf galaxies.},

abstract = {We present custom-processed UV, optical, and near-IR photometry for the RESOLVE survey, a volume-limited census of stellar, gas, and dynamical mass within two subvolumes of the nearby universe (RESOLVE-A and -B), complete down to baryonic mass {\~{}}10{\^{}}9.1-9.3 Msun. In contrast to standard pipeline photometry (e.g., SDSS), our photometry uses optimal background subtraction, avoids suppressing color gradients, and includes systematic errors. With these improvements, we measure brighter magnitudes, larger radii, bluer colors, and a real increase in scatter around the red sequence. Combining stellar masses from our photometry with the RESOLVE-A HI mass census, we create volume-limited calibrations of the photometric gas fractions (PGF) technique, which predicts gas-to-stellar mass ratios (G/S) from galaxy colors and optional additional parameters. We analyze G/S-color residuals vs. potential third parameters, finding that axial ratio is the best independent and physically meaningful third parameter. We define a "modified color" from planar fits to G/S as a function of both color and axial ratio. In the complete galaxy population, upper limits on G/S bias linear and planar fits. We therefore model the entire PGF probability density field, enabling iterative statistical modeling of upper limits and prediction of full G/S probability distributions for individual galaxies, with two-component structure for red colors. We use the RESOLVE-B 21cm census to test several PGF calibrations, finding that most systematically under- or overestimate gas masses, but the full probability density method performs well.},

Several objects are close analogues to the prototypical cE, M32. These objects, which are more massive than previously discovered UCDs of the same size, further call into question the existence of a tight mass-size trend for compact stellar systems, while simultaneously strengthening the case for a universal "zone of avoidance" for dynamically hot stellar systems in the mass-size plane.   Overall, we argue that there are two classes of compact stellar systems: 1) massive star clusters and 2) a population closely related to galaxies. Our data provide indications for a further division of the galaxy-type UCD/cE population into two groups, one population that we associate with objects formed by the stripping of nucleated dwarf galaxies, and a second population that formed through the stripping of bulged galaxies or are lower-mass analogues of classical ellipticals. We find compact stellar systems around galaxies in low to high density environments, demonstrating that the physical processes responsible for forming them do not only operate in the densest clusters.},

abstract = {We study the relationships between galaxy environments and galaxy properties related to disk (re)growth, considering two highly complete samples that are approximately baryonic mass limited into the high-mass dwarf galaxy regime, the Environmental COntext (ECO) catalog (data release herein) and the B-semester region of the REsolved Spectroscopy Of a Local VolumE (RESOLVE) survey. We quantify galaxy environments using both group identification and smoothed galaxy density field methods. We use by-eye and quantitative morphological classifications plus atomic gas content measurements and estimates. We find that blue early-type (E/S0) galaxies, gas-dominated galaxies, and UV-bright disk host galaxies all become distinctly more common below group halo mass {\~{}}10{\^{}}11.5 Msun, implying that this low group halo mass regime may be a preferred regime for significant disk growth activity. We also find that blue early-type and blue late-type galaxies inhabit environments of similar group halo mass at fixed baryonic mass, consistent with a scenario in which blue early types can regrow late-type disks. In fact, we find that the only significant difference in the typical group halo mass inhabited by different galaxy classes is for satellite galaxies with different colors, where at fixed baryonic mass red early and late types have higher typical group halo masses than blue early and late types. More generally, we argue that the traditional morphology-environment relation (i.e., that denser environments tend to have more early types) can be largely attributed to the morphology-galaxy mass relation for centrals and the color-environment relation for satellites.},

@article{Georgiev2009,
abstract = {(Abridged) Using luminosities and structural parameters of globular clusters (GCs) in the nuclear regions (nGCs) of low-mass dwarf galaxies from HST/ACS imaging we derive the present-day escape velocities (v{\_}esc) of stellar ejecta to reach the cluster tidal radius and compare them with those of Galactic GCs with extended (hot) horizontal branches (EHBs-GCs). For EHB-GCs, we find a correlation between the present-day v{\_}esc and their metallicity as well as (V-I){\_}0 colour. The similar v{\_}esc, (V-I){\_}0 distribution of nGCs and EHB-GCs implies that nGCs could also have complex stellar populations. The v{\_}esc-[Fe/H] relation could reflect the known relation of increasing stellar wind velocity with metallicity, which in turn could explain why more metal-poor clusters typically show more peculiarities in their stellar population than more metal-rich clusters of the same mass do. Thus the cluster v{\_}esc can be used as parameter to describe the degree of self-enrichment. The nGCs populate the same Mv vs. rh region as EHB-GCs, although they do not reach the sizes of the largest EHB-GCs like wCen and NGC 2419. We argue that during accretion the rh of an nGC could increase due to significant mass loss in the cluster vicinity and the resulting drop in the external potential in the core once the dwarf galaxy dissolves. Our results support the scenario in which Galactic EHB-GCs have originated in the centres of pre-Galactic building blocks or dwarf galaxies that were later accreted by the Milky Way.},
